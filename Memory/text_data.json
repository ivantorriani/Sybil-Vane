            "headline": "Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?",
            "text": "Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?\n\nGetty Images\n\nThree weeks ago, just days after being formally chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was pressed on her plans for a sit-down interview. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to my team,\u201d she told reporters on the airport tarmac in Detroit. \u201cI want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\u201d On Thursday night, Ms Harris will - just barely - make good on that promise, sitting down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for her first major interview. But Ms Harris will not be there by herself. The vice-president will be joined by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for the prime-time appearance, airing at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST). Ms Harris may have answered the question of when she would conduct an in-depth, substantive discussion of her candidacy and agenda - standard procedure for all major party presidential candidates. But with Mr Walz in tow, the decision to make this a joint appearance may also fuel growing criticism that after escaping the rigours of a months-long presidential primary, she is now dodging the scrutiny that comes with a solo interview.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly weak, weak sauce, to show up with your running mate,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W Bush, on CNN, adding that Harris had a \u201ctroubling lack of confidence\" in her own political ability. Still, supporters of Ms Harris insist that given the unprecedented nature of her candidacy following President Joe Biden's sudden departure from the race, she is taking things at a smart pace. \u201cI think the cadence has been right,\u201d said Peter Giangreco, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. \u201cWin the nomination, pick your nominee, lay out your economic plan, do your convention and now do some sit-downs and amplify that.\u201d Joint interviews featuring both members of a presidential ticket are not unusual. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sat for an interview with 60 minutes after Mr Biden was selected as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Eight years later, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did the same. For Ms Harris and Mr Biden in 2020, they picked ABC\u2019s 20/20. And less than a week after Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the pair were jointly interviewed on Fox. But since Mr Biden passed the torch to her late last month, Ms Harris has limited most of her engagement with the press to scripted and highly-controlled environments. Her last formal sit-down interview was on 24 June, more than two months and a political lifetime ago. Her occasional interactions with reporters - brief answers to shouted questions on her way to and from campaign events - have done little to quell Republican claims that she is shirking any opportunity to have her record and agenda put under the microscope.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe harshest criticism comes from her Republican opponents, who have both given several interviews in the past month. \u201cShe\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Mr Trump told media earlier in August. \u201cShe won\u2019t do interviews with friendly people because she can\u2019t do better than Biden.\u201d The Democratic nominee has enjoyed a surge in momentum since entering the race. Now, after her whirlwind introduction to American voters, she needs to \"reinforce\" that energy, said Republican strategist and Trump critic Chip Felkel. \u201cShe\u2019s gotta get out there,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got to show that she can think under pressure, because that\u2019s part of what the president has to do.\u201d Since she campaigned in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Ms Harris has switched her stance on several key policy positions, backing off some of her more liberal promises. She has abandoned pledges to support Medicare for all (giving all Americans access to government-funded healthcare) and to ban fracking. And the vice-president now supports a bipartisan border bill that includes hundreds of millions of dollars on a border wall, something Ms Harris once called \"un-American\". These apparent changes could open her up to questions about being a policy flip-flopper - an unwelcome label for a candidate still trying to define herself. But by doing a joint interview, the Harris campaign may have calculated that the pressure - and the difficult questions - will at least be shared between the two of them. And it ensures both are in lockstep when it comes to explaining policy. Mr Giangreco, the Democratic strategist, predicted Ms Harris and Mr Walz will try to turn the focus onto their economic plan, an agenda to lower the cost of living and provide economic security that she first announced at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, two weeks ago. Mr Giangreco also pointed to another potential benefit of a joint interview: drawing a contrast between Mr Walz and his Republican counterpart JD Vance who he has labelled as \"weird\".\n\nKamala Harris accepts Democratic nomination 'on behalf of the people'"

            "headline": "Walz\u2019s Campaign Trail Includes Stories of Helping With Lice on Facetime, Talking About the Perils of Gutters",
            "text": "When Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate for this November\u2019s presidential election, most Americans had no idea who the Minnesota governor actually was. But as people outside of Minnesota get to know Walz, it\u2019s becoming clear through a torrent of stories shared online that he\u2019s one of the most likable politicians around. Why? He just seems like a very normal and kind person. And it\u2019s hard to find a sharper contrast between Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate JD Vance than \u201cnormal and kind.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump and Vance are clearly frustrated with being called \u201cweird,\u201d a verbal jab against modern Republicans that was first popularized by Walz. But Trump and Vance are clearly stumped about how to hit back. Because every new day online seems to deliver an anecdote or story from Walz that makes him seem both relatable and caring. And after years of Trumpism dominating the headlines with an ideology built on cruelty and humiliation, a guy like Walz is extremely refreshing.\n\nTake an old story about Walz that started going viral on Wednesday. Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, was interviewed by Politico about the fact that she would become the first Native American woman to be governor of any state. At the end of the interview, Flanagan told a story about how Walz helped her when her child got lice.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nI heard you say that your daughter was discovered to have lice the day after the 2018 election. Can you share how the newly elected Walz-Flanagan ticket handled that early crisis? My first instinct was to call Congressman Tim Walz, also governor-elect Tim Walz, to say, \u201cHelp, my child has lice, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d So that was interesting. But he was amazing. I was super freaked out. We\u2019d never dealt with it before. Siobhan was a total trooper. He said, \u201cGo to Target, and then FaceTime me from the aisle.\u201d And so I did. He had me show all the different shampoos and stuff. He was like, \u201cThis is the one that you get.\u201d And then he\u2019s like, \u201cOnce you get home, FaceTime me again.\u201d So I FaceTimed him again from the bathroom, as I\u2019m picking nits out of my child\u2019s hair. And he was amazing and coached me through the whole thing, and that is who Tim Walz is.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of story that we\u2019re hearing more and more about Walz over the years. As a teacher and coach, he touched the lives of so many people as a helpful father figure, as so many of his former students tell it. And the army of pro-Trump trolls who are trying to take him down just don\u2019t understand his appeal.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s been going viral this week involving Walz is his interview with Subway Takes on TikTok. Walz discusses how important he thinks good gutter maintenance is. And it\u2019s just the latest example of Walz talking about normal things that normal people discuss in their everyday lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to post the most vile things imaginable on social media. For example, Trump retweeted an image on Truth Social that showed Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris with the caption, \u201cFunny how blowjobs impacted both of their careers differently.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d as it were is that Clinton\u2019s husband was involved with a White House intern in the 1990s and Harris was dating Willie Brown. The right has repeatedly tried to claim, without any evidence, that she only succeeded professionally because she was dating Brown. It\u2019s a common attack from retrograde assholes. But normal people don\u2019t find it amusing. At least they don\u2019t anymore.\n\nThe late-night comedians of the 1990s tore Monica Lewinsky to shreds with those kinds of jokes. But here in the 2020s, the U.S. public sees Lewinsky much differently than she was depicted in late 20th-century news and comedy programs. And that\u2019s probably why these assholes don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re the weird ones. Guys like Trump and Vance are trying to bring America back to the 1990s, back when Trump thought he was hot shit and Vance was a kid. Both men are trying to turn back the clock, from their stupid jokes to their ideas about reproductive health. But there\u2019s a reason that Harris has embraced a slogan that really seems to resonate with most people: We\u2019re not going back."

            "headline": "X Straightens Up Grok After Election Misinformation Warnings",
            "text": "Few mainstream social media sites have become more inundated with misinformation since the 2020 presidential election than X. Elon Musk bought the platform formerly known as Twitter in late 2022 and quickly instituted policies that allowed the worst elements of society to thrive. But X reportedly fixed at least one problem recently identified by several state attorneys general with the AI chatbot Grok. And it may be a small fix, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nWhat was the problem with X\u2019s Grok? Apparently, when you asked it questions about the 2024 election, the AI would repeatedly get things wrong about election laws. When President Joe Biden stepped aside on July 21 to allow Kamala Harris to run, Grok users were fed all kinds of information that simply wasn\u2019t true when asked about how things would change in the race.\n\nThe secretaries of state for Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Washington all wrote a joint letter to Elon Musk and X about the problems on August 5. The letter laid out some of the most concerning problems, like the answers Grok would give about whether Harris still had time to get on the ballot to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nFrom the letter, which was also published online:\n\nWithin hours of President Joe Biden stepping away from his presidential candidacy on July 21, 2024, false information on ballot deadlines produced by Grok was shared on multiple social media platforms. The post from Grok said, \u201cThe ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election. Some of these states include: 1. Alabama 2. Indiana 3. Michigan 4. Minnesota 5. New Mexico 6. Ohio 7. Pennsylvania 8. Texas 9. Washington.\u201d This is false. In all nine states the opposite is true: The ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nWhile the letter notes Grok is only available to paying subscribers on X, and includes a disclaimer about the fact that Grok can get things wrong, the secretaries of state noted how the false information about ballot deadlines had \u201cbeen captured and shared repeatedly in multiple posts\u2014reaching millions of people.\u201d And that\u2019s the bigger problem. Grok is a relatively niche service for people who are dumb enough to give Elon Musk money. However, the information from Grok can spread far and wide if people share screenshots on X and other social media sites. Especially if that information confirms existing biases or preconceived notions for confused individuals, like the idea that Harris is somehow ineligible to become president.\n\nBut Grok has reportedly been fixed, at least when it comes to information about ballot deadlines. The secretaries of state released a new letter on Monday praising X for doing something about it. Grok now directs users to Vote.gov, which has accurate information about voting rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate X\u2019s action to improve their platform and hope they continue to make improvements that will ensure their users have access to accurate information from trusted sources in this critical election year,\u201d the new letter reads. \u201cElections are a team effort, and we need and welcome any partners who are committed to ensuring free, fair, secure, and accurate elections.\u201d\n\nAs the secretaries of state note, the finer points of election rules can vary by state, which can make it difficult to keep things straight. But Vote.gov has the information that people need. And as long as Grok directs people there, rather than making shit up, things should be alright.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., all elections are run by local officials, who are supported and overseen by a state agency,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cElection rules and procedures can vary widely from state to state, and voters should seek out information from their local election officials about who can vote when they can vote, and how they can vote in their area. Websites like Vote.gov and CanIVote.org are also trustworthy resources that can connect voters with their local election officials.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to register to vote. Depending on where you live, the deadline could be coming soon."

            "headline": "Harris' first sit-down interview as nominee airs Thursday with pressure building",
            "text": "Harris explains policy shifts and her 'day one' in 1st sit-down interview as nominee\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nVice President Harris outlined her day-one agenda to support middle-class families if she were to win the election this fall in her first sit-down interview since becoming the Democratic nominee for president. She addressed plans to make housing more affordable and to expand the child tax credit, and she acknowledged that despite economic growth since the pandemic, prices are still too high for many Americans.\n\n\u201cPrices, in particular for groceries, are still too high. The American people know it. I know it,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris, who was joined by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sat down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for the interview during a campaign swing in Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe wide-ranging conversation was a high-stakes moment for Harris, after she had faced mounting pressure to do an interview with a major news outlet to share her own policies and take questions on her prior positions, some of which have changed since she became President Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020.\n\nBash pressed Harris on her shifted stances on both banning fracking and decriminalizing border crossings. Harris in 2019, when she first ran for president, said she was against a fracking ban and was for decriminalizing border crossings. Her stance on both policies has changed since then \u2014 but Harris insisted that her values have not.\n\n\u201cI think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is, my values have not changed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\u201d\n\nHarris said she would keep her word that she would not ban fracking \u2014 an issue that is front and center in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd on decriminalizing border crossings, Harris said, \u201cI believe there should be consequences. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHarris also addressed foreign policy, namely the continued U.S. aid to Israel in its war in Gaza. When asked if Harris would withhold some shipments of weapons to Israel, Harris did not directly answer the question, and instead reiterated her call for a ceasefire deal and getting the hostages home.\n\n\u201cI remain committed since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self determination and dignity,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the interview, Harris also committed to having a Republican in her presidential cabinet \u2013 and said it would be to the benefit of the American public to have someone who has different views and different experiences working with her.\n\nThe interview was wide-ranging, covering Walz\u2019s record and past controversies, President Biden\u2019s legacy and ability to serve, as well as the phone call between Biden and Harris the day he decided to step down from the race.\n\nQuestions over Walz\u2019 comments on weapons of war, and his path to having children\n\nWalz had only a few questions directed at him during the interview. He was asked about previous comments he made in 2018 about carrying a weapon into war \u2013 which Walz never did. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war and my wife, the English teacher, telling me my grammar is not always correct,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cMy record speaks for itself\u2026 I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWalz and his wife used a method known as IUI to have children \u2013 but has said they used IVF in the past. On that issue, Walz said he thinks most Americans \u201cget it if you\u2019ve been through that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child,\u201d he said.\n\nNew details on the call between Biden and Harris when Biden stepped down\n\nHarris revealed that she was spending time with her family, cooking breakfast and about to sit down for a puzzle when Biden called her last month to let her know he was ending his campaign for reelection.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 \u201d Harris said.\n\nShe noted that Biden made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that he was going to support Harris\u2019 campaign for president. She called the president \u201cselfless\u201d and said he puts the American people first.\n\nRepublicans like Trump had been accusing Harris of trying to dodge tough questions\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a month since Biden dropped out of the race, and in the absence of a 1-on-1 Harris interview or press conference, Republicans have accused the vice president of trying to dodge the press to avoid tough questions. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done an interview,\u201d former President Donald Trump said during a news conference earlier this month at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent, and she can\u2019t do an interview.\u201d\n\nPrior to becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris had taken plenty of questions from reporters as the sitting vice president. Her team says she\u2019s done 80 interviews this year \u2014 in traditional, network media as well as on podcasts and social media.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut in these previous conversations she was generally selling Biden\u2019s agenda. Like most vice presidents, she was a messenger and a deputy. Now, she\u2019s running for the top job, and this CNN interview may be one of the first times she\u2019s pressed to spell out her own policies and answer questions about how, if at all, she would govern differently than Biden.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d have to answer more of these questions,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible to run for president and not answer them.\u201d\n\nHarris will, undoubtedly, face additional scrutiny about her record and positions when she faces off against Trump in the debate expected next month.\n\nTrump, for his part, posted on his platform Truth Social as the interview with Harris aired on CNN.\n\n\u201cI look so forward to Debating Comrade Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is. Harris has changed every one of her long held positions, on everything,\u201d he said. He also posted: \u201cBORING!!!\u201d\n\n"

Now they finally have a presidential ticket that explicitly echoes their agenda.\n\nThese activists and their diverse coalition \u2014 who call themselves YIMBYs, for \"yes in my backyard\" \u2014 have sprung into action to support Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. On Wednesday night, they held a two-hour virtual \"YIMBYs for Harris\" fundraiser featuring dozens of local, state, and federal lawmakers who believe in building lots more housing.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nPro-housing advocates say Harris' proposal to build 3 million homes in her first term, in part through cutting government regulations restricting construction, feels like a big shift toward addressing the country's housing shortage. It doesn't hurt that Harris selected as her running mate a governor who has championed pro-housing policies in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris and other top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, highlighted the housing shortage in their speeches at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 sending YIMBYs into a tizzy. Democrats in Washington have long supported demand-side housing policies, including subsidies for homebuyers and low-income renters. But recent national messaging on the issue has focused much more squarely on solving the supply shortage, which is particularly severe in blue states and cities where onerous permitting requirements, environmental reviews, and opposition from so-called NIMBYs \u2014 \"not in my backyard\" \u2014 have hamstrung efforts to build more homes.\n\n\"There's always been Democrats saying we should fund more affordable housing,\" Armand Domalewski, a San Francisco-based data analyst who helped organize YIMBYs for Harris, told Business Insider. What's new on the national stage, he added, is \"the perspective that part of the issue is local and state governments obstructing housing.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nShortly after Domalewski set up a WhatsApp group for pro-housing voters about three weeks ago, \"it just exploded,\" he said. About 300 people are in the chat, he said, and the group estimated that about 6,000 people attended Wednesday's virtual fundraiser, which raised more than $100,000.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, a headliner at the fundraiser, argued that his party was experiencing a \"generational shift\" in its approach to housing. He's called Harris \"the first presidential nominee in at least a generation that cares about housing.\" Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado similarly described Harris at the event as \"the most pro-housing president in the history of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want somebody that is actually going to work to solve the problem of the housing shortage,\" Schatz said. \"And the simplest way to solve the problem of the housing shortage is to make it permissible for people to build as much housing as they can, especially for working people.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, a 46-year-old California Democrat who's been one of the loudest urbanist voices in Congress, noted in his remarks during the fundraiser that he was organizing the first YIMBY congressional caucus.\n\nThe fact that housing policy is high on the list of national Democratic priorities indicates how severe the affordability crisis has gotten. Harris, Obama, and other top Democrats aren't suddenly YIMBY converts \u2014 they're talking about the housing shortage because Americans are more worried about it. In a recent survey , 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans said they thought a lack of affordable housing was a significant problem.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't said much on the campaign trail about housing, though he and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have argued they could solve the supply shortage by deporting millions of immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral speakers at the YIMBY fundraiser argued that, despite being the anti-regulation party, Republicans had embraced red tape that limits what can be built and where. In the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 agenda, Ben Carson, who was Trump's secretary of housing and urban development, wrote that Republicans should \"oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning.\""

However, if nothing is done to address the dearth of housing supply, then jump-starting nationwide demand will simply exacerbate the housing crisis as people scramble to snatch up already-scarce homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The demand side doesn't help over the long run,\" Olsen said. \"If you want sweeping policy that's very generalizable, have it be on the supply side.\"\n\nOlsen also doesn't think the first-time homebuyer criteria is the most useful way to increase housing access for those who need it the most.\n\n\"I could be a first-time buyer, but I have a great network, a bank of mom and dad, that could help me move forward. And now you've given me an extra boost,\" Olsen said.\n\nFocusing on boosting first-generation homeownership could help combat that issue, which Harris' plan addresses, although the exact details have yet to be revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Olsen believes a federal down payment assistance plan is simply a band-aid fix for structural issues in the US housing market \u2014 namely, lack of supply.\n\n\"It can end up just getting us revved up without solving the long-run problem,\" Olsen said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHere's what will actually help home affordability\n\nThat's not to say that all down payment assistance plans are doomed to fail. When done right, these programs can be quite beneficial, Olsen said.\n\nThe key comes down to whether such a plan is implemented at the federal or local level. According to Olsen, local homebuying incentives that increase demand are more targeted than a blanket federal policy like the one Harris proposed, making them more effective in increasing homeowning accessibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, a state with a low population might have a lot of underused infrastructure. In this case, incentives to boost housing demand at the state level could help redistribute people to areas with excess home supply.\n\n\"If you want to solve things with the demand side of the coin for the long run, it's gonna be more about 'How do I get the people to want to go where the supply is?'\" Olsen said.\n\nBut again, Olsen believes that policies increasing the housing supply are the most effective way to alleviate the current housing crisis.\n\nHarris has actually put out proposals addressing the supply side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion aims to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. The fund will provide $20 billion in funding to lower land use restrictions, modernize zoning policies, stimulate development, and encourage innovative housing solutions. This plan emphasizes building multifamily rental units and starter homes for middle-class families, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of units.\n\nAnd the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit provides tax credits to developers who build affordable housing units, which helps low-income tenants in finding affordable and available units. This policy encourages mixed-income developments such as multifamily housing rented to tenants from a variety of income backgrounds."

            "text": "Harris is on a 2-day Georgia bus tour. It\u2019s the latest sign the state is in play\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are back on their campaign bus. The pair are together on the campaign trail for the first time since last week\u2019s Democratic convention. This time, they\u2019re on a two-day bus tour of Georgia.\n\nTheir trip is taking them into areas of the state that don\u2019t always get attention from Democratic politicians. It will also be the site of Harris\u2019 first major network interview since becoming her party\u2019s nominee for president, on Thursday.\n\nThe attention this week is just the latest sign that Georgia, a state President Biden narrowly won in 2020, is once again in play this election year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThis area is a priority for the campaign: we have nearly 50 full-time staff across 7 offices in South Georgia,\u201d said Porsha White, the Georgia state director for the Harris campaign, ahead of the trip. \u201cThis will be the first time a general election presidential candidate will have campaigned in Savannah since the 1990s.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpon arrival in Savannah, Harris and Walz greeted students from Savannah State University, the oldest public HBCU in Georgia, before boarding their campaign bus.\n\nTheir first stop on Wednesday was to a marching band rehearsal at Liberty County High School, which, according to U.S. News and World Report, has about 1,000 students, a majority of them \u201ceconomically disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nThe room erupted when Harris and Walz walked in, and the band played the school fight song with football players and cheerleaders in the back of the room. Leaning into his experience as a former coach, Walz gave a quick speech about teamwork. Harris told the crowd they were all leaders in their own way.\n\nNext stop: Sandfly Bar-B-Q in Savannah, a restaurant decorated with license plates from various states. Harris and Walz were greeted by the restaurant's owner, employees and local patrons. Walz sought out a group of teachers and praised their \u201cnoble\u201d work. He talked about the importance of optimism and insisted, \u201cOur politics can be hopeful.\u201d Outside, a man held a Trump flag.\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Harris stopped by Dottie\u2019s Market in Savannah, where she told the owner she plans to announce a tax credit to boost small business creation. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to be rolling out next week is basically a tax credit for startups, small business startups,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLater was a rally at the city's Enmarket Arena, where she outlined her vision to \"fight for America\u2019s future\" that included Medicaid expansion, focusing on middle- and working-class families and expanding reproductive rights.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader strategy to reach voters in traditionally Republican areas in swing states\n\nSavannah \u2014 like most major cities \u2014 votes strongly Democratic. But it is swimming in a sea of red \u2014 and that\u2019s where Harris and Walz are campaigning.\n\n\u201cThe whole point is to overperform,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie. \u201cAnd so you want to overperform not just among your base, but you also want to overperform in places where you have historically been weak.\u201d\n\nThat means campaigning far from the Democratic strongholds of Atlanta, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C., to narrow the margins in parts of those competitive swing states that have typically voted Republican. In other words, losing by less.\n\nIn Georgia, where reliably Republican voters still outnumber reliably Democratic ones, that\u2019s really the only way to have a chance at winning.\n\n\u201cDemocrats also want to perform better than they historically have in other parts of the state, so you want to be able to post stronger margins \u2014 even if they are losing margins \u2014 in other parts of the state,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nBoth campaigns put money and time into Georgia\n\nIn presidential races, there are two big indicators of how campaigns are feeling about their chances in a state: time and money. Since Harris got into the race, Donald Trump and his allies have spent nearly $33 million on ads in the state, mostly trying to define Harris with pretty negative messaging. Meanwhile Harris and her allies have spent nearly $23 million, mostly on more positive ads introducing her to voters. That\u2019s according to an NPR analysis of data from the tracking firm Ad Impact. People watching TV in Georgia are seeing a ton of campaign ads already.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToday, the Harris campaign launched its first \u201ccontrast\u201d ad, hitting Trump and tying him to the unpopular conservative roadmap known as Project 2025. That will be on heavy rotation in Georgia and other swing states.\n\ntoggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Harris campaign has invested in 24 offices around Georgia, including in more traditionally Republican areas. Since Harris started running for president, White says they\u2019ve brought in 35,000 new volunteers.\n\nAs for time: Trump held a rally in Georgia earlier this month \u2014 though he spent part of his speech bashing the state\u2019s Republican governor. (Trump has since made a public show of saying they\u2019ve worked things out.) This week\u2019s bus tour is Harris\u2019 second trip to the state in less than a month.\n\nPolling averages show the race remains close \u2014 and it\u2019s much closer with Harris at the top of the ticket than when Biden was the presumptive nominee . Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes. But the state\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators are proof that a Democrat can win if they run a near-perfect campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign will also be turning up the heat in the state this week in an effort to win it back. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene plans to head to a volunteer phone bank in Rome, Ga. In a release she cites \u201cdozens of paid staff, thousands of volunteers, and field offices in every part of the state, from Atlanta to Savannah to the Valdosta. Team Trump will not leave a stone unturned this fall.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, Georgia is a must-win state. For Harris, it would open up additional paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win.\n\n\n\nHarris and Walz will take a pitstop in Georgia to do an interview\n\nAs Harris and Walz meet voters in person, they are also set to sit down for their first television interview together. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash interviewed them at Kim\u2019s Cafe, a Black-owned restaurant in Savannah, this afternoon. It will air at 9 p.m. EST on CNN.\n\nFor the entirety of Harris\u2019 nascent candidacy, she has been in a position to control the message, and she has largely delivered prepared remarks from teleprompter. The interview is, of course, a different format, where she is likely to be pressed on areas where her position has changed since the Democratic primary in 2020, when she supported some version of Medicare for All, opposed fracking and didn\u2019t have as hard of a line on immigration and border security as she does now.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe won\u2019t be alone. Walz will also be part of the interview, which means there likely will be some questions about their relationship and how they would work together \u2014 questions that by their nature are not as perilous as trying to explain policy shifts.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been publicly badgering Harris to do an interview, in part because they are looking for something to pounce on where they can actually get some traction. They have been trying unsuccessfully for five weeks to end her campaign honeymoon and make some attacks stick, and this interview is the best chance they\u2019ve had in a while.\n\nAlready, Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance is criticizing Harris and Walz for doing a joint appearance rather than having Harris sit for a grilling alone. But it\u2019s not clear how much voters really care about these intricacies."

He is accused of running the platform where these crimes took place, not committing the crimes himself. Durov co-founded the popular messaging app in 2013.

Telegram users typically find the service attractive due to its limited oversight of what they can say. This has made the app a favorite tool for far-right extremist groups, terrorist organizations and criminal gangs. Investigators say Durov failed to cooperate with them, which would have helped them shut down the illegal operations. He is now under judicial supervision and banned from leaving French territory.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump shared a TikTok video yesterday including footage that likely violates federal law against using military cemeteries for campaigning purposes. The video was posted after NPR reported Trump campaign staffers had a physical altercation Monday with an Arlington National Cemetery staffer who was trying to enforce restrictions during a remembrance ceremony.

She found in her reporting that these efforts have swept up U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote. Maintaining voter rolls is a critical election safeguard and federal law says it can\u2019t happen within 90 days of an election. Advocacy groups have asked Tennessee and Alabama to halt sending letters to people they suspect are noncitizens, saying it's violating federal law. Tennessee later said people who received letters wouldn\u2019t be purged from voter rolls.

            "headline": "What's Your 'Sleep Language'? Here Are the 5 Different Types and How to Speak Yours",
            "text": "There's a reason why experts suggest adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. From preventing forgetfulness to impacting your life expectancy, there's a laundry list of health reasons you should be getting quality sleep each night. However, reaching that goal isn't always easy. It can be difficult to find the correct code of hacks to unlock your sleep potential and get the rest your body needs.\n\nShelby Harris, a clinical sleep psychologist, is aiming to crack that code through partnership with the popular meditation app and mental health brand Calm. Harris and Calm have published a working understanding of the \"five sleep languages\" -- a sectioning off of a few different sleeping patterns (or lack thereof) to give people more actionable steps to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNET\n\nHarris said she came up with the five different sleep languages after considering differences among her patients over her 20 years of experience and noticing that there are a handful of categories they tend to fall into.\n\n\"We can give people a whole list of sleep hygiene targets to follow or when they should see a sleep doctor, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming for people,\" Harris said. The goal of the different sleep languages is to meet people where they are in their sleep health journey.\n\n\"It helps to guide where they want to go with what they can start with.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about your sleep language and how to use this knowledge to improve your sleep. For more advice on how to improve your sleep quality, here are eight ways to promote sleepiness and how your diet is linked to your sleep.\n\nThe 5 sleep languages and tips for speaking yours\n\nHarris has landed on five sleep languages, but it's important to note you can switch between them throughout your lifetime, she says.\n\nBelow are the five sleep languages, as described in Calm's blog.\n\n1. The 'gifted' sleeper\n\nIf you're a gifted sleeper, you probably appear to the people around you just as that -- gifted, in the name of sleep. Maybe you can fall asleep anywhere, no matter the noise or background light, or you have no problem napping. Any way you slice it, the gifted sleeper typically doesn't have a problem falling or staying asleep.\n\nTips for the gifted sleeper\n\nWhile this may seem like the \"best\" sleep language category to belong to, objectively speaking, gifted sleepers might want to see a sleep doctor if they're sleeping too much, as it could be a sign of a health condition. It can be especially important to follow up with a doctor if you're sleeping a lot but still not feeling well rested.\n\nBut if there isn't something else at play, consider whether you're actually playing catchup on sleep deprivation and whether you can benefit from a stricter sleep routine, according to the Calm post.\n\n2. The 'words of worry' sleeper\n\nIf you're a \"words of worry\" sleeper, you might know who you are. Your brain is loud at night, clouded with the \"what ifs\" of the day, and what you have to get done tomorrow. Whether it be the past or the present, a words of worry sleeper is focused on another time other than the present and the physical focus at hand: sleep.\n\nTips those who worry about sleep\n\n\"I have a lot of patients that come to me where their brains just won't turn off,\" Harris said. If you can relate to this, be clear on your sleep boundaries and limit things like screen time, or cross-contaminating nonsleep activities in the bedroom, like work. You may also benefit from adding a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation to your day, or trying this CNET to-do list hack for better sleep.\n\nWorking or scrolling in bed is a no-go when you're looking to improve your sleep. Skaman306/Getty Images\n\n3. The 'routine perfectionist' sleeper\n\nIf you're a perfectionist sleeper, you may have followed our sleep advice a little too hard to the detriment of your happiness, and sometimes, your sleep. You may be a perfectionist sleeper if you find yourself missing out on fun events, or other special occasions that may be important to you, over fear of having one night of poor sleep. Or when something or someone throws your sleep off, you're irritated.\n\n\"Those people I often see because they used to be a words of worry person or have some type of sleep issue, that then they became hyperobsessed with it,\" Harris said.\n\nTips for those a little too perfect about sleep\n\nAs laid out in the Calm blog, perfectionist sleepers will benefit from a little more flexibility and switching things up -- things that will create \"less attachment\" to your sleep routine. To get started, move around the order of your sleep routine slightly (maybe you'll brush your teeth before you put on your pajamas today, for example).\n\nLike the other sleep languages, a perfect sleeper may benefit from practicing mindfulness, which can improve your ability to relate to anxiety-inducing thoughts in a way that's not so stressful.\n\n4. The 'too hot to handle' sleeper\n\nIt's in the name, but if you're too hot to handle, you're too hot to sleep. Menopause, perimenopause, other health conditions or even a mismatched bed partner with a different internal temperature can make you too hot to handle.\n\nTips for sleep hotties\n\nIf you're waking up drenched in sweat, or you're finding yourself frequently uncomfortable at night, check in with your doctor to see what underlying health condition may be at play. Medication side effects or hormonal changes can also influence how warm you feel at night, as the Calm post points out.\n\nBut if your bed partner is the culprit, follow this CNET tip and consider getting two separate blankets or comforters, which can also cut down on blanket tug-of-war.\n\n5. The 'light as a feather' sleeper\n\nLight sleepers wake up easily from noise, light or even a strong smell. If you're light as a feather, you might wake up in the morning after a solid seven or eight hours on the pillow still feeling unrested or sleepy.\n\nTips for those light as a feather\n\nIf you're restless and not getting the quality of sleep you want, consider sharpening your bedtime routine and adding a bit more structure -- including setting those bed boundaries, like not scrolling through social media or eating in your bed. (Loose crumbs itching your bare legs may be the last thing a light sleeper needs.)\n\nCalm and Harris also suggest reaching out to a sleep professional if you're concerned about the quality of your rest, screening for sleep conditions such as sleep talking, grinding teeth and sleep apnea.\n\nD3sign/Getty Images\n\nThe link between mental health and sleep\n\nHarris says she decided to partner with Calm in response to the current mental health crisis. The pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of anxiety, eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Mental health can be improved or harmed by someone's sleep patterns.\n\nSleep deprivation, in particular, can affect your ability to stay in control of your emotions or come up with solutions to seemingly not-so-complicated problems that can feel like the end of the world when you're sleep-deprived. (I asked Harris if there was any truth to my feeling like I regress to a child's ability to handle emotions when I'm sleep-deprived, and she explained that sleep deprivation disrupts the part of our mind responsible for reasoning and judgment, and our ability to toggle between states, or our cognitive flexibility.)\n\n\"With sleep deprivation in general, we find higher rates of anxiety, higher rates of depression, higher rates of stress,\" she said. \"And we find their stress tolerance and ability to cope with daily stressors becomes much more difficult.\"\n\nThe critical component is REM sleep, which you may be deficient in if you're regularly lacking sleep. This could lead to problems in your relationship or at work.\n\n\"REM sleep is really important for emotion processing, memories,\" Harris said. \"If you're waking up early or you're not getting enough REM sleep routinely, you're gonna have trouble with irritability, depression, anxiety, all that jazz.\"\n\nAnother bottom line on good sleep\n\nDespite the number of times we preach the health benefits of sleep, there's a thread in society that may be pushing back against the idea that healthy sleep trumps all. But according to Harris, \"No pun intended, you're living in a dream world a little bit,\" if you're trying to check off everything else on the wellness list before you start prioritizing sleep. Centering sleep will help you stabilize and prioritize all the other tasks you have during the day.\n\n\"We have to stop the hamster wheel somewhere, and if you stop it by prioritizing sleep, it makes the daytime run smoother.\""

            "headline": "How Beau Biden Set the Stage For Kamala Harris\u2019 Stunning Political Rise",
            "text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere were days the pair talked to each other more than they spoke to the people who slept under their roofs.\n\nKamala Harris was the state attorney general of California and Beau Biden was in the same role over in Delaware, where so many of the banks she was fighting were based. At the height of the clean-up from the 2008 financial crisis, more than a million California households caught up in the foreclosure wave were struggling to stay in their homes. For Harris to help any of them, she needed backup from Biden, who had oversight over Wilmington, Del., the banking industry's stealth capital. That partnership helped Harris emerge as one of the only political leaders in the country seen as holding bankers accountable for predatory practices.\n\nBeau Biden had Harris\u2019 flank until the end of his too-brief life, which ended in 2015 at age 46. Five years later, the man Beau called \u201cPop\u201d tapped Harris as his running mate, creating one of the most unlikely partnerships in Democratic politics. And when President Joe Biden decided to forgo the nomination this year and clear the way for Harris, it was the dividend on an accidental alliance forged in the early 2010s when two rising stars of the Democratic Party aligned and, to the point it\u2019s become canon, actually became sincere friends.\n\nBeau Biden was atop Harris\u2019 mind last month when she accepted the elder Biden\u2019s endorsement to be the next President. \u201cI first came to know President Biden through his son, Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe\u2019s leadership as President.\u201d\n\nTrite? Sure. But it has the benefit of also happening to be true.\n\nUp until Beau Biden\u2019s death, Joe Biden long believed his son had the potential to surpass his own impressive political career. So when the elder Biden tapped Harris four years ago this month, it was in no small measure based on her true friendship with the younger Biden. As I wrote at the time, one question hung over his deliberation more than any other: What Would Beau Do? That\u2019s how Biden got to yes on Harris, despite his primary rivalry with her and a skepticism that she actually believed in the vision for America she was pitching in her own White House run.\n\n\u201cI first met Kamala through my son Beau,\u201d Biden said during his roll-out of Harris. \u201cHe had enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one\u2019s opinion I valued more than Beau\u2019s, and I\u2019m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Joe Biden stood aside to give Harris her best shot to date at winning the top job in global politics. In ways great and small, it was a moment set up by Beau Biden, who in the aughts connected with his colleague in California and decided they\u2019d be great partners\u2014and, perhaps, the future of their shared Democratic Party. One succumbed to brain cancer and the other is currently leading Donald Trump in most national polls. What started as a check on banking overreach now stands to be the driving force behind Democratic politics. And, from the outside, it looks like a not entirely bad level of match-making.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter."

            "text": "After major police endorsement, Rep. Gallego faces backlash from progressive groups\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nAfter drawing praise for an endorsement by Arizona police, Rep. Ruben Gallego has now drawn anger and disappointment from some Arizona progressives for discouraging the Department of Justice from imposing federal oversight on the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department \u2014 sent one day after the Arizona Police Association announced it\u2019s backing Gallego in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race \u2014 the congressman said federal investigators \u201cmissed the mark\u201d in their examination of Phoenix police.\n\nThat nearly three-year investigation concluded in June that Phoenix police have engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of using excessive force, acting with bias and violating constitutional and civil rights.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn his letter, Gallego described those violations \u2013 \u201ca mere 120 or so unspecified incidents across eight years,\u201d he wrote \u2013 as isolated, not pervasive. And he argued against the need for federal oversight for the city\u2019s police department, a position aligned with some of the Phoenix City Council members, who\u2019ve resisted calls from community groups for the DOJ\u2019s further involvement.\n\nPhoenix police and city officials \u201calready welcome reforms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOversight, Gallego wrote, would be best left to local government.\n\n\n\nPolice back \u2018a freaking loser\u2019\n\nWhen it was announced Monday, the Arizona Police Association\u2019s endorsement was a coup for Gallego\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe APA describes itself as an umbrella organization \u2013 \u201can association of associations\u201d \u2013 that brings together various law enforcement entities from across the state. In doing so, they represent thousands of law enforcement officers in Arizona.\n\nThe week prior, APA President Justin Harris had joined Donald Trump onstage at a rally in Glendale to announce the organization\u2019s support of the former president \u2013 someone who Harris said could get our country \u201cback on track and make America great again.\u201d\n\nAlso onstage that day, Trump described Gallego as \u201ca freaking loser.\u201d\n\nDays later, the APA endorsed that \u201closer\u201d \u2013 \u201ca Marine combat veteran\u201d who \u201cunderstands the complexities of modern policing in American society today,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe APA does not take our endorsements lightly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe recognize the importance of having a U.S. senator that can bring people together to improve society for all. We believe Congressman Gallego will be that U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an endorsement that should come in handy as Gallego defends his record from the Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee, Kari Lake, who the APA endorsed for governor in 2022.\n\nWhile a Lake spokesperson accused Gallego of supporting the defunding of police, Harris praised the congressman for backing federal legislation to boost hiring and retention of police officers.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gallego has continually fought for robust, increased funding for America\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Just lost my vote\u2019\n\nGallego\u2019s letter stunned Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona.\n\n\u201cTo act as if (the DOJ\u2019s report) is in some way not accurately reflective of \u2013 detailing the significant problems with the Phoenix Police Department, is simply not true,\u201d Keenan said.\n\nThe timing of the letter, immediately following the endorsement of the state\u2019s largest independent law enforcement organization, made it worse, he said.\n\n\u201cIt seems very transactional,\u201d Keenan said.\n\n\u201cA lot of city officials and Rep. Gallego, they speak about public safety,\u201d he added. \u201cBut true public safety cannot ignore constitutional rights. It cannot ignore the violence perpetrated by the Phoenix Police Department on members of our community. And to issue statements like this is, frankly, dangerous, because it will embolden the police not to reform themselves.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Poder In Action, a community group that routinely lodges complaints about police treatment of Black, brown and Indigenous communities, called the claims in the letter \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to the communities Gallego represents in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is really just ridiculous to, after all of this evidence, to say that this department can change itself,\u201d executive director Viri Hernandez said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHernandez also said she wasn\u2019t shocked Gallego\u2019s letter came on the heels of the APA endorsement.\n\n\u201cOur community sees the way that police unions, when they support candidates, most of the time \u2014 every example we\u2019ve seen \u2014 also leads to those candidates pushing back against accountability, transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether the police endorsement was tied to the DOJ letter, a spokesperson for the Gallego campaign says there was \u201cno agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuben Gallego has a record of fighting for Arizona\u2019s law enforcement in Congress and is proud to have the support of the Arizona Police Association,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nPoder In Action isn\u2019t in the business of endorsing candidates. As a 501(c)3, they\u2019re barred from intervening in political campaigns. \u201cOur focus is to expose the discrepancies, the lies from any party \u2013 Democrats or Republicans,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell folks who to vote for, who to not vote for,\u201d she added.\n\nNeither does the ACLU of Arizona. But personally, Keenan didn\u2019t mince words when he first responded to the letter on X."

Read preview\n\nDonald Trump is worried about the use of AI in the forthcoming election.\n\nThe former president has called AI \"very dangerous\" and accused his opponent, Kamala Harris, of using it to exaggerate the size of one of her rally crowds.\n\n\"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?\" Trump said in a lengthy, capital-letter-strewn Truth Social post earlier this month.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\n\"There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d it,\" he wrote, adding: \"She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Trump's claim, the crowds shown in the image were genuine. An official from the Harris-Walz campaign told Business Insider that the photo had been taken by campaign staff and \"not modified by AI in any way.\"\n\nIn the weeks following his post accusing Harris of using AI, the former president went on to post several apparently AI-generated memes on Truth Social and X. The images depicted real-life figures, including Kamala Harris and Elon Musk.\n\nHe also reshared on Truth Social a set of dubious images of Taylor Swift and her fans with pro-Trump messaging. While two of the images appeared to show a genuine Trump supporter, others, including several images of women in \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirts, had telltale signs of being AI-generated.\n\nTrump later denied making the images himself and reflected on the use of AI more generally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're seeing it all the time,\" Trump said of AI-created content. \"It's a little bit dangerous out there.\"\n\nThe Swift photos had already attracted criticism online and made headlines. While that may have been exactly what Trump wanted, the former president's willingness to post what looks like AI-generated content without clear labels risks confusing some voters.\n\nViral misinformation\n\nExperts have long feared the widespread use of AI has the potential to affect elections around the world.\n\nDeepfakes, AI-generated text, and hyper-targeted ads can blur the line between fact and fiction, making it harder for voters to discern what is credible information. Bad actors can also use AI tools to purposely spread realistic disinformation on social media at an unprecedented scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublic literacy around AI-generated content also varies. While some people can easily identify fake content, others can be convinced by fake images or text.\n\n\"This content is also going viral before anybody has really fact-checked it,\" Eric Wengrowski, the CEO of Steg.AI, told Business Insider. \"It's also coming from a former president.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWengrowski said while it wasn't unethical for politicians to share AI-generated content for humorous or satirical reasons, public figures should ensure the content is labeled as AI.\n\n\"I do think it's unethical for politicians to be sharing AI-generated content if it is not clearly labeled with the appropriate watermark,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegal consequences\n\nThe legality of posting AI-generated images that use the likeness of public figures is also murky.\n\n\"It really depends on how the content is being presented,\" Brent Mittelstadt, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, said. \"If it's clearly being presented as a joke or as satire, then you're in a much stronger legal position.\"\n\n\"If something to a reasonable person would obviously be satire, then at a minimum, with things like copyright or usage of somebody's likeness, you can basically get around legal obligations in that way,\" he said.\n\nIn the case of the Swift-related content, Mittelstadt said it wasn't clear if the images were being presented as memes or satire. \"It's not to a reasonable person obviously fake, just from the content itself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for Trump did not respond to a request for comment from BI."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris Redefines \u2018American Exceptionalism\u2019 for a New Generation of Voters",
            "text": "Stengel is the former Editor of TIME, an MSNBC analyst and the author of Information Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation .\n\nIn the final moments of her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris said it was time \u201cto fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth.\u201d She then paused and said, \u201cthe privilege and pride of being an American.\u201d\n\nThat sentence is the most full-throated and sincere expression of American exceptionalism since the presidency of George W. Bush, and the most direct and unambiguous expression of that idea by a Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cI love our country with all my heart,\u201d she said a few seconds before, adding, \u201cWe are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nHard to say it more directly than that. That is in many ways the modern definition of American exceptionalism.\n\nThe idea of American exceptionalism has been mostly out of favor since it was seen as an underpinning of President Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. For Democrats, it has been a perilous concept for longer than that. American exceptionalism is the idea that the U.S., because of its unique history and origin, because of its founding documents, the Declaration and the Constitution, has a special role not only in the creation of modern democracy but in preserving it around the world. It\u2019s the idea that America is a moral beacon and has a providential role and responsibility to lead.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is a 20th century term, but the idea is older than the nation. Its inspiration comes from John Winthrop\u2019s famous 1630 sermon in which he said America \u201cshall be as a city upon a hill.\u201d It\u2019s a biblical reference that Ronald Reagan made famous and used hundreds of times in his political career. Reagan, who became the exemplar of exceptionalism, believed that Americans, as John Adams once said, were \u201cthe chosen people\u201d with a special destiny determined by the Almighty.\n\nBut the model of foreign policy exceptionalism comes from a different President: Woodrow Wilson. In trying to overcome American isolationism before World War I, it was Wilson who understood that he needed to appeal to American values\u2014the values of freedom, fairness, and equality, and an almost messianic sense of America\u2019s role in the world. This became known as foreign policy idealism, and every American President since Wilson has had to at least nod in that direction.\n\nFor the most part, American exceptionalists are, well, American. Foreigners tend to see the idea of American exceptionalism falling somewhere between naivet\u00e9 and narcissism. We are often regarded as hypocrites who tout our moral superiority while behaving in ways that are self-serving or damaging.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism became a campaign issue when Barack Obama was running for President in 2008. In an interview that year, Obama was asked whether he believed in American exceptionalism, and he replied, \u201cI believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.\u201d Well, let\u2019s just say that did not do the trick. In fact, his lukewarm embrace of the idea was seen as a rejection of American exceptionalism.\n\nI once heard Henry Kissinger say he thought Obama would be the first American President in his lifetime not to be an American exceptionalist. During the Republican primary in 2008, Mike Huckabee accused Obama of not being truly American, saying, \u201cTo deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation.\u201d The GOP turned the idea of exceptionalism into a political weapon. Their argument was, if you don\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism, you don\u2019t love this country and you don\u2019t deserve to lead it. Obama began to play defense and tried to embrace the idea of exceptionalism, as he said later that same year, \u201cOur exceptionalism must be based on our Constitution, our principles, our values, and our ideals.\u201d The subtext: It\u2019s not our size or military might that make us exceptional but our ideals, and the times we struggle to live up to those ideals, like the civil rights movement, are a part of that exceptionalism.\n\nRead More: How Kamala Harris Took \u2018Freedom\u2019 Back from the GOP\n\nHarris picks up where Obama left off but adds something new: Her\u2019s is a personal American exceptionalism, an exceptionalism seen through the prism of her own life and the immigrant experience. Her explanation of her own story suggests that what makes America exceptional is that it\u2019s a place where the child of an Indian immigrant mother and a Jamaican immigrant father can become the nominee for President.\n\nTraditionally, Americans of color were less enamored of the idea of American exceptionalism than white Americans. But recent data show that Americans of foreign and minority backgrounds have a higher degree of faith in America\u2019s promise than white Americans. A 2019 Cato Institute survey found that more immigrant citizens than native-born Americans are somewhat proud or very proud to be an American. A 2023 PRRI/Brookings survey found that more Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Black Americans than white Americans believe America\u2019s best days are ahead of us rather than behind us. And according to 2024 Pew Research Center polls, 75% of Indian Americans and 80% of Asian Americans\u2014higher percentages than white Americans\u2014say they have either achieved or are on their way to achieving the American Dream.\n\nHarris\u2019s embrace of American exceptionalism is a political twofer: It\u2019s a way to appeal both to some conservative voters who may have previously seen the Democratic Party as rejecting traditional red-white-and-blue patriotism and to the millions of legal immigrants who are indeed grateful for the privilege of being an American. In fact, the U.S. foreign-born population surpassed 46 million in 2022, the largest number in American history. That\u2019s almost 15% of the population, the greatest percentage of Americans with immigrant backgrounds since 1910. Naturalized American citizens constituted about 10% of the overall electorate in 2020, a record high. That percentage has only grown. That\u2019s a lot of voters, particularly in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada, which have hundreds of thousands of eligible immigrant voters.\n\nThe irony is that Donald Trump rejects the idea of American exceptionalism and is in fact an American declinist. He has said on numerous occasions that the American Dream is dead and that we are a failed nation. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan isn\u2019t an assertion of global leadership but rather a declaration of intent to withdraw and prioritize self-interest.\n\nThe first sentence of the 2016 platform of the Republican Party said, \u201cWe believe in American exceptionalism.\u201d Their nominee said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the term.\u201d And indeed he doesn\u2019t. When Trump was interviewed by Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News in 2017, O\u2019Reilly said \u201cPutin\u2019s a killer.\u201d Trump replied, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d He is a relativist about America, who doesn\u2019t think our values make us special but that the U.S. is just as morally compromised as other nations. The 2024 platform of the Republican Party doesn\u2019t mention \u201cexceptionalism.\u201d\n\nAuthoritarians don\u2019t like the idea of exceptionalism. Exceptionalism makes people feel special, it empowers them\u2014it promotes democracy. Just take it from Vladimir Putin, who wrote in a 2023 New York Times op-ed, \u201cIt is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.\u201d\n\nHarris used the term \u201cself-determination\u201d twice in her acceptance speech. Self-determination is the opposite of autocracy. It\u2019s a term that President Wilson referenced in his famous Fourteen Points speech that proposed the League of Nations, and it\u2019s a cardinal principle in international law. It is also a guiding principle of the immigrant\u2019s view of American exceptionalism, that here people can determine their own future. And that is who Harris was thinking of when she accepted the nomination. \u201cOn behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth,\u201d she said, \u201cI accept your nomination to be President of the United States.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Aug. 29\n\nThe original version of this story misidentified an American President in one instance. The author believes Kamala Harris has made the most \u201cfull-throated expression of American exceptionalism\u201d since the presidency of George W. Bush, not George H.W. Bush."

And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.\"\n\n'Next question, please,' Harris brushes off Trump's race comments\n\nHarris was asked to respond to former President Donald Trump's comments at the National Association of Black Journalists convention where he appeared to question Harris' race.\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said at the time.\n\nWhen asked about the comments by Bash, Harris responded, \"Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.\"\n\nThe CNN interview will air Thursday night at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris\u2019s Gamble",
            "text": "In the first month of Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s improbable run for President, she allowed Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm about finally having a credible opponent to Donald Trump to define her candidacy. Once Joe Biden left the race and Harris let her intentions be known, the excitement vastly outweighed the need to know precisely what policies she was running on. Tens of thousands of people joined Zoom calls to raise funds and created networks aimed at supporting the Vice-President\u2019s run. Thousands more stood in line for hours to pack arenas for rallies, which became staging grounds for crafting the themes of her developing campaign.\n\nAt those rallies, the framing of her campaign came into focus. Harris adhered to typical liberal fare: raising the minimum wage and providing affordable housing and health care. She has been more pointed in her intentions to fight for abortion rights and to extend protections and rights to L.G.B.T.Q. people. By choosing as her running mate the genuinely populist governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, over the more moderate Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, Harris delighted progressives.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nBut the most excitement about Harris\u2019s surprise candidacy has been generated without her having to say a word. Her presence at the top of the ticket, as a biracial woman and the daughter of two immigrant parents, has served as a backlash to the backlash against 2020\u2019s national reckoning with the history of American racism. Even as Harris and Walz have deftly avoided any mention of race or racism in this contest, its centrality to the looming election is undeniable.\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party\u2019s long campaign to end affirmative action was finally realized by a U.S. Supreme Court packed with Trump appointees. Books about slavery and racism against African Americans and school curricula teaching Black history have been banned in some states and localities. In Florida, in an effort that has since been challenged in court but which captured the national mood, Republican legislators passed the so-called Stop WOKE Act, which tried to manage the teaching of Black history based on whether it was perceived to make white students feel guilty. Universities in states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Utah have closed centers and offices dedicated to diversity.\n\nSince Harris became the presumptive nominee, Trump has attacked her racial identity, intentionally mispronounced her name, and questioned her intelligence, going so far as to call her \u201cdumb.\u201d His running mate, J. D. Vance, has supported a national ban on abortion and described people without children as inferior to parents. Under these circumstances, supporting Harris can feel like an act of resistance.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention provided Harris with the opportunity to spell out the specifics of why she should be promoted to President. It was organized to project a new image of Harris as tough and, as her husband, Doug Emhoff, put it, \u201cready to lead.\u201d Democrats seized the opportunity to claim they were charting a new course for the country, emphasizing themes of joy and patriotism; the crowd periodically broke out into chants of \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d Love of country was laced throughout the speeches, in contrast to Trump\u2019s regular descriptions of the U.S. as a hellscape that only he can rescue. As Michelle Obama intoned, Harris \u201ctruly understands\u201d what has \u201calways made America great.\u201d The emotive goals of the Convention seemed to have been met, but what of the opportunity to map out the meaning of a Harris Presidency?\n\nFor all the talk about moving forward, the Democratic Party decided to feature the parts of its past that most troubled its core constituencies of Black and young voters. Bill Clinton made his mark on the Party by championing a turn away from social welfare and civil rights. His legacy includes policies that fuelled mass incarceration and demonized poor Black people, especially Black women, whom he made the focal point of his efforts to abolish welfare as an entitlement. During her campaign for the Presidency in 2016, Hillary Clinton was hounded by Black Lives Matter activists for referring to juveniles in 1996 as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Barack Obama may be adored by many, but it was under his Administration that Occupy Wall Street and the Black Lives Matter movement erupted, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises of his historic run for office.\n\nThat the Party featured the old guard while still claiming a new path reflected the tensions throughout the Convention: joy alongside Harris\u2019s bellicose promise of pursuing American values abroad with \u201cthe strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\u201d; challenges to misogyny and promotion of different kinds of family, but no concrete details on how Harris would address the crisis in child-care costs and the rising costs of living. The Convention featured four of the wrongly convicted, and since exonerated, Central Park Five before a segment that celebrated Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor. Most pointedly, speakers repeatedly framed the election as a struggle for democracy and a fight for freedom, yet the D.N.C. refused to give a single Palestinian American any time on the main stage. The refusal was in contrast to the Convention\u2019s parade of Republicans, who were given speaking slots because they rejected Trump.\n\nThese conflicting messages seemed intended to inspire and embolden the base while also reaching voters who have not yet made up their minds. This dual purpose left Harris ill-equipped to speak about how she and her party plan to address the central issues of the election, including the hardships driven by economic inequality and inflation. Instead, she offered vague platitudes, promising an \u201copportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed.\u201d Harris pledged to \u201cend\u201d the housing shortage, with no details of how she would do it. There was almost no attempt to address the social questions that so sharply defined the 2020 race, when Harris was selected as Vice-President. Then, Harris decried \u201cstructural racism,\u201d injustice in our criminal-justice system, and \u201cexcessive use of force by police.\u201d In sum, she concluded, \u201cthere is no vaccine for racism. We\u2019ve gotta do the work.\u201d The new Democratic Party platform also featured this dramatic shift, burying the fight for racial justice of 2020. For the first time since 2012, the Party\u2019s platform does not oppose the death penalty; it calls for more police, without emphasizing police reform.\n\nTo be sure, much has changed since 2020. But Harris is gambling that the millions of people who marched in search of resolution to the crisis of racism that year will simply move forward on this well-trodden path to the future. The Democratic Party is gambling that the nomination of a Black and Indian woman alone will satisfy the desires for racial justice. It is a risky strategy. The G.O.P. is prepared to flood the airwaves with an assortment of comments that Harris has made that will validate the \u201cliberal\u201d label. As one G.O.P. strategist put it, \u201cThe archive is deep.\u201d In Harris\u2019s previous run for President, she supported universal health care and free tuition for students at public colleges and universities. She raised the possibility of \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She opposed fracking and called for an end to juvenile incarceration.\n\nEven though Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren are among the most popular Democrats in the country, and an unabashed strategy of leveraging public dollars to rebuild the U.S. economy and promising to address racial discrimination produced one of the largest voter turnouts in American history, Harris and the Party leadership have acquiesced to the terms of the Republican backlash and rejected anything having to do with the successful 2020 election. Instead of explaining why she has supported these positions, in hopes of persuading an electorate desperate for change and possibly open to her reasoning, Harris is trying to reinvent herself on the fly."

            "headline": "What I Heard at Swifties for Kamala",
            "text": "You might not be shocked to learn that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s favorite Taylor Swift song is about cosmic justice.\n\n\u201cI love \u2018Karma,\u2019\u201d the senator from Massachusetts said last night during a Zoom event for a group called Swifties for Kamala. \u201cAnd I have a thing or two to say about private equity!\u201d The 34,000 attendees probably would have cheered, but, as is typical for such a massive webinar, only the organizers had control of the microphone and camera. Warren was undaunted by the lack of response. \u201cIt is going to be a tough fight ahead,\u201d she said, winding up. \u201cThere are only 24 hours in a day\u2014or 144 \u2018All Too Well\u2019 10-minute versions.\u201d [Pause for no laughter.] \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, just like you\u2019ve done every time before, we will push this boulder up the hill.\u201d\n\nOnly a die-hard Swiftie would have caught all the references in Warren\u2019s words, which included a jab at the investment group backing Swift\u2019s nemesis, Scooter Braun, and a lyric from a Swift deep cut said to be about the singer\u2019s beef with Kim Kardashian. It seems safe to assume that Warren did not write all of these quips herself. But she would not be the only speaker on the call whose staffers had squeezed an unconscionable number of jokes into last night\u2019s remarks.\n\nRead: The Millennial cringe of Taylor Swift\n\nIdentity-based calls to action have been all the rage in this season of Democratic politics, with events like White Dudes for Harris and Win With Black Women drawing tens of thousands of attendees. Although America\u2019s Swifties are not an ethnic or racial group, they are arguably a religious one. Last night\u2019s call was an attempt to harness their unflagging devotion to the pop star and put it to political use.\n\nThe whole thing was, somehow, even cringier than I had anticipated\u2014and, as a Swiftie myself, I am familiar with the fandom\u2019s extreme dorkiness. The organizers looked startlingly young and inexperienced\u2014introducing lawmakers in shaky voices, clearly nervous to be blindly addressing thousands of viewers. They passed the mic too often, rambled, and misspoke. And the middle-aged politicians were working painfully hard to demonstrate fluency in the dialect of Swiftworld.\n\nStill, the cringe seemed, at least partly, the point. Like the broader Harris campaign, these organizers leaned into the awk. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about how joy isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d Irene Kim, a Swifties for Kamala co-founder and its executive director, said on the call, citing a recent New York Times op-ed. \u201cBut that definitely hasn\u2019t been our experience!\u201d\n\nThe project began with a post by a 22-year-old named Emerald Medrano, who runs a popular Swift fan account. \u201cI feel like us U.S. swifties should mass organize and help campaign for Kamala Harris,\u201d he wrote on X in July. Soon, Swifties for Kamala was born: a partnership of fans, some of whom run social-media accounts and others who have experience in Democratic politics. A month later, the group has 71,000 followers on X, a Substack newsletter, and a Discord channel.\n\nThe organizers seem to assume that Swift, who backed Joe Biden in 2020, will support the Democratic nominee. But Swift has not actually endorsed anyone yet, a fact that went unacknowledged in last night\u2019s call. Her support in the race is highly sought after; last week, Donald Trump shared tacky AI deepfakes to claim he had the pop star\u2019s backing. During the Democratic National Convention, rumors swirled of a surprise musical performance: Would it be Taylor? (No.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping things political, but also everything has a layer of Swiftiness to it,\u201d Annie Wu Henry, the campaign manager at Swifties for Kamala, who has also worked for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive lawmakers, said during last night\u2019s call. Organizers wore Swift-themed cardigans and displayed glittery #47s on their hands, in reference to what could be Harris\u2019s place in the presidential timeline. They encouraged viewers in the Zoom chat to chip in either $13 or $19.89\u2014both important Swiftian numbers\u2014and, like Taylor, they frequently folded their hands into hearts for the camera.\n\nRead: Taylor Swift\u2019s post-Reputation approach to politics\n\nThe Zoom event was light on policy talk, heavy on allusion. After Warren spoke, Representative Becca Balint of Vermont offered a pep talk: \u201cThe MAGA movement will be defeated by our dominoes, cascading in a line!\u201d she said, quoting the song \u201cMastermind.\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York read off a few jokes. \u201cKarma is a relaxing thought, but for Donald Trump it\u2019s not\u2014facts!\u201d she said, to the ever-silent audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re in line to vote, stay, stay, stay!\u201d When Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts showed up, he revealed that his favorite Swift song is, oddly, \u201cSnow on the Beach\u201d\u2014because it highlights the risks of global warming. \u201cClimate change is threatening our favorite phenomenon,\u201d the senator said, before adding that the waters outside Swift\u2019s beach house in Rhode Island are \u201csome of the fastest-warming \u2026 in the world!\u201d\n\nJust like a Taylor Swift marketing campaign, the Zoom call promised surprises and exciting guests. There would be a big announcement at 8 p.m., organizers teased, and a very special person would wrap up the call at about 8:30 p.m. One special speaker was the singer-songwriter Carole King, now in her 80s, who materialized like a yellow-haired fairy godmother. King, who called Swift her \u201cmusical and songwriting granddaughter,\u201d sang part of the chorus from \u201cShake It Off,\u201d and offered advice to first-time campaign volunteers: \u201cThe key to door-knocking is asking a good question and then listening.\u201d She urged Swifties to ask voters what they might find in common with Harris. \u201cYou\u2019re building a bridge to that person,\u201d King said\u2014aware, apparently, of how much Swifties appreciate bridges.\n\nAt 8 o\u2019clock, the big announcement was made: Merch drop! Swiftie T-shirts and tote bags reading In My Voting Era were for sale\u2014no affiliation, organizers carefully reminded fans, with Swift herself.\n\nNearly two hours into the call, the surprise final guest\u2014Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a rising Democratic star\u2014still hadn\u2019t appeared. The leaders of Swifties for Kamala began signing off. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed, and so happy and fully immersed in Swiftie-ism right now,\u201d Medrano said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to paint the town blue, and it\u2019s going to be the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened in this country!\u201d\n\nThe letdown didn\u2019t kill their enthusiasm\u2014with Swifties, it never does. The group had raised money at a clip that the capitalist icon herself would have been proud of: The night\u2019s fundraising haul totaled an auspicious $122,000. If Harris is hoping that joy and\u2014yes\u2014cringe can help her win the White House, she\u2019s got the right fandom on her side."

            "headline": "Seven Questions That Should Be Easy for Harris to Answer",
            "text": "A presidential nominee normally accounts for their past actions in public life and clarifies their plans for the future. This year, Kamala Harris ran in no primaries, and since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not had a formal press conference where she would be expected to answer questions from reporters. She has not sat down for an in-depth interview on television or with a major paper such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. (CNN recently announced that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will be interviewed by one of the network\u2019s anchors this week.) This avoidance may be a strategy to keep the \u201cgood vibes\u201d of her campaign going, but it does a disservice to voters and bodes poorly for how transparent and forthcoming Harris would be if she wins the presidency.\n\nBefore Harris was vice president or a U.S. senator, she spent roughly a quarter century in the criminal-justice system\u2013\u2013she was California\u2019s attorney general, San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, and a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, a job she took shortly after graduating from law school. Her work as a prosecutor constitutes the bulk of her career. She wrote a 2009 book, Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor\u2019s Plan to Make Us Safer, laying out her policy views. And she has talked a lot about criminal-justice issues in her years as a national politician.\n\nYet even her positions on important criminal-justice issues remain unclear, because of inconsistencies in her actions and statements and failures to address tough questions posed by critics of her record.\n\nRead: The prosecutor vs. the felon\n\nI sent the Harris campaign questions that voters deserve to have answered: about her record as a \u201ctop cop,\u201d about apparent changes in her rhetoric and positions, and about what policies she would pursue if elected. At the time of publication, her campaign hasn\u2019t provided any answers, but should that change, this story will be updated. Here are some of the questions I asked, edited for clarity and concision:\n\nDaniel Larsen, an unsympathetic defendant, was convicted of felony possession of a knife in 1999 after police testified that they saw him throw the weapon under a car in a Los Angeles parking lot. He got 28 years in prison. But as it turned out, a witness\u2013\u2013James McNutt, a retired Army sergeant first class and former police chief\u2013\u2013had been in the parking lot that night with his wife; both gave sworn statements that they saw a different man, William Hewitt, throw the knife under the car. Hewitt swore that\u2019s what happened too. So did Hewitt\u2019s girlfriend. Yet at trial, Larsen\u2019s attorney failed to identify or call any of those witnesses; he also failed to request that the knife be examined for fingerprints or to argue that it belonged to someone else. He was later disbarred for failing other clients.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, just before you became attorney general of California, Judge Suzanne H. Segal ruled that Larsen\u2019s case was one of those \u201cextraordinary cases where the petitioner asserts his innocence and establishes that the court cannot have confidence in the contrary finding of guilt.\u201d She declared that \u201cno reasonable juror would have found Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that he \u201cclearly received ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d The state was ordered to retry the case or release Larsen.\n\n\n\nBut while you were attorney general, your office filed an appeal attempting to block Larsen\u2019s release, because he hadn\u2019t filed his claim for relief in a timely manner. In other words, your office sought to keep a man in prison on procedural grounds, despite strong evidence of his innocence. As a result, Larsen spent two more years in prison, until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he had cleared the threshold for producing proof of innocence. Even then, your office continued to litigate the matter, arguing before a three-judge panel that \u201cone reasonable juror could still vote to convict.\u201d When that failed, forcing the prisoner\u2019s release, your office worked to prevent Larsen from receiving funds earmarked for people who are wrongly convicted of crimes.\n\n\n\nWhy did your office work so hard to keep a man in prison after it was clear that he didn\u2019t commit the crime that put him there?\n\nIn 2010, when you were San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, a scandal rocked the crime lab run by the San Francisco Police Department. A technician who analyzed drugs was deemed \u201cincreasingly UNDEPENDABLE for testimony\u201d by an assistant DA, a co-worker observed that the area where she tested drugs was in \u201cdisarray,\u201d an audit found missing evidence, and the technician\u2019s sister reported that she had a vial of cocaine at her house. She ultimately acknowledged taking evidence home for personal use. Her behavior raised the prospect of unreliable analysis and testimony in hundreds of cases. But neither you nor your office notified defense attorneys in potentially affected cases.\n\n\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported on a judicial rebuke you received, writing that the judge \u201cconcluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys\u201d about problems in the crime lab, violating the rights of defendants. At the time, you defended your behavior and criticized the judge as biased. Later, while you were running for president in 2020, The Washington Post asked about the matter, and reported that you \u201ctook responsibility for the failings,\u201d including your failure to develop a written policy so that your office \u201cwould notify defendants about problems with witnesses and evidence.\u201d You told the Post, \u201cNo excuses. The buck stops with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the future, if a federal prosecutor is found to violate a defendant\u2019s rights, what consequences should he or she face?\n\nIn Smart on Crime, you championed putting more police officers on the street, arguing that it would mean faster responses to assaults and robberies and fewer quality-of-life crimes. \u201cVirtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see police officers walking a beat,\u201d you wrote. \u201cThis is as true in economically poor neighborhoods as wealthy ones.\u201d But in a June 2020 radio interview, you said, \u201cIt is old thinking, it is outdated, and is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.\u201d That same month, appearing on The View, you said: \u201cIn many cities in America, over one-third of their city budget goes to police \u2026 What are we doing? What about the money going to social services? What about the money going to helping people with job training? What about helping with the mental-health issues that communities are being plagued with?\u201d\n\n\n\nDid something cause you to change your position in the years after you published your book? If so, what? Do you still believe that cities should pay to put more police officers on the street?\n\nWhen you were attorney general of California, the ACLU faulted you for failing to protect the privacy of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cOn your watch as California\u2019s top cop, law enforcement agencies up and down the state have been secretly using social media surveillance software that has been marketed to monitor protests and activists of color,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHighly invasive facial recognition that may have a disproportionate impact on Californians of color is also being quietly used in several of our largest cities and counties. As the Attorney General, your leadership is urgently needed to address the lack of transparency, accountability, and oversight of law enforcement surveillance technology in order to fulfill your duty to safeguard the privacy, free speech, and civil rights of Californians.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat, if anything, did you do in response to that letter? And how does that response reflect your position on how transparent the government should be about the surveillance technologies that it uses?\n\nAs attorney general of California, you were criticized for taking a hands-off approach to credible abuse allegations against local prosecutors and police. \u201cHarris sent an unmistakable signal,\u201d the investigative reporter R. Scott Moxley wrote in a scathing 2019 OC Weekly article. \u201cUnder her watch, police-agency employees in California were free to commit perjury\u2014even in death-penalty cases, as they did in Orange County.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter multiple Oakland police officers were accused of having sex with an underage girl, \u201ccivil rights lawyers and California residents had been pleading for then-Attorney General Kamala Harris to open an independent investigation into the situation, since it spanned several police departments and involved allegations of coverups,\u201d Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote in Reason magazine. \u201cBut she never responded to the petitions and pleas asking her to look into systemic sexual exploitation by state agents in Oakland.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Campos, a former San Francisco supervisor and police commissioner and a vice chair of the California Democratic Party, told The New York Times, \u201cWe never thought we had an ally in the district attorney \u2026 When she had the opportunity to do something about police accountability, she was either not visible, or when she was, she was on the wrong side.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow would you answer critics who say that you did too little to police the police, and if elected president, what approach would you take to federal oversight of law enforcement?\n\nDavid Daleiden is an anti-abortion activist. In 2015, he pretended to be a representative of a fetal-tissue-procurement company and met with Planned Parenthood, and later released surreptitiously taken videos to show those staffers discussing the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the videos were misleadingly edited. On July 31, 2015, the National Abortion Federation filed a lawsuit claiming that Daleiden violated privacy laws when taking the videos. As AG, you opened a criminal investigation. Daleiden was indicted by your successor. In a lawsuit, Daleiden says that he was targeted for prosecution because Planned Parenthood is an ideological ally that has given you campaign contributions.\n\n\n\nUndercover videos are sometimes used by journalists and activists on the right and the left. The people taking the videos argue that doing so is in the public interest and that they are exposing misconduct. Do you favor or oppose laws that make it unlawful for journalists and activists to surreptitiously capture video and release it to the public? How do you propose ensuring that such laws are enforced in an evenhanded manner?\n\nAs San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, you prosecuted parents for their children\u2019s habitual failure to attend school. Do you think district attorneys nationwide should pursue similar policies or that the risks of overly harsh enforcement are too high?\n\nRead: Why Kamala Harris\u2019s politics are so hard to pin down\n\nCandidates aren\u2019t informed about every issue. Sometimes, a reasonable answer is \u201cI have to think about that and get back to you.\u201d But Harris is well versed in all of these issues, having pondered them for years. Voters deserve to know where she stands on them today."

            "headline": "U.S. Army Confirms Trump Staffer \u2018Pushed\u2019 Arlington Staffer Before Filming TikTok Ad",
            "text": "Donald Trump is facing new questions on Thursday about a stunt the former president filmed at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week. Photos of the 45th president giving a big thumbs up were the first to surface in an incredibly tacky, if typical, move for Trump. But new revelations from that day have been trickling out, including allegations of a physical altercation between Trump\u2019s staff and a staff member at Arlington, as well as the fact that Trump likely broke federal law while filming the ad at the cemetery.\n\nIt all started Monday when Trump appeared at Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony wreath for 13 U.S. military service members killed at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan during the American withdrawal in 2021. Federal regulations prohibit the filming of campaign commercials and the production of publicity material, but Trump brought along a crew to document his little stunt.\n\nAs the New York Times points out, Trump was in a heavily restricted part of the cemetery known as Section 60, which is primarily for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a staff member at Arlington approached his camera crew. There was a physical altercation, with Trump\u2019s staff insisting they should be allowed to film in the restricted area for their stupid little commercial.\n\nThe Arlington staff member has reportedly declined to press charges against Trump because it \u201ccould subject her to retaliation from Trump supporters,\u201d as the Times reports. And that\u2019s a reasonable fear, given the fact that Trump is the guy who tried to literally overthrow the U.S. government on January 6, 2021, and his followers are some of the most violent extremists around.\n\nThe Trump camp has tried to play down the incident and campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even slandered the Arlington staff member as mentally unstable on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump\u2019s team during a very solemn ceremony,\u201d Cheung told NPR.\n\nCheung added to NPR, \u201cWe are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made.\u201d But no footage showing details of the physical altercation has been released yet and NPR writes that when a reporter asked to see the footage, the Trump campaign declined.\n\nThe Army released a new statement about the incident on Thursday to defend the unnamed staff member at Arlington (ANC), who was simply trying to enforce the rules.\n\n\u201cParticipants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\u201d an unnamed Army spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation\u2019s fallen deserve,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe Trump campaign has released several staged videos from that day, and Trump himself says in one of the videos he\u2019s churned out for social media that, \u201cWe lost 13 people great, great people, what a horrible day it was,\u201d referring to the last day U.S. forces were officially in Afghanistan under wartime conditions. And then Trump insisted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose one person in 18 months and then they took over that disaster of leaving Afghanistan.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true, of course. The Associated Press fact-checked his claim back in 2022 and reported there was no 18-month period during his presidency without casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nBut all of that is really beside the point. Trump clearly broke the law by trying this idiotic move at a place widely revered as a site of quiet contemplation. As he does with everything, Trump turned it into a circus all about himself.\n\nThe law Trump broke by filming at the cemetery is 32 CFR \u00a7 553.32, according to the Washington Post, which prohibits any politician from engaging in political activity at the site. The newspaper talked with legal experts who emphatically explained that \u201cif the campaign was filming during the wreath-laying ceremony for partisan political activities, that would be a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nTrump is struggling in the national polls, as he and Kamala Harris have just a little over two months before Election Day. And it\u2019s clear that Trump will do anything he can\u2014including breaking federal law\u2014in a desperate bid to retake power. With any luck, the former president will fail in those efforts. But things could get a lot weirder before they get any better on November 8."

Read preview\n\nAs a retirement tsunami looms in the US, life after work is top of mind for many. And some Americans worry they'll survive longer than Social Security.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies released its 2024 retirement outlook for the middle class. It delved into the financial concerns and retirement preparations for those with annual household incomes of $50,000 to $199,999 using a sample of just over 10,000 people \u2014 about 5,000 of whom fell into the middle-class category.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs it turns out, middle-class workers have plenty of worries about retirement. Their greatest fear is outliving their savings and investments.\n\nAmong those with household incomes of $50,000 to $99,000 and those with incomes of $100,000 to $199,000, 40% of both groups said that sticking around longer than their nest eggs was one of their greatest fears in retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat comes as middle-class Americans expect to live to a median age of 90, over a decade more than the US's current life expectancy of 77.5. Americans aged 65, which is about the average retirement age, can expect to live an average of 18.4 more years \u2014 a significant amount of time to rely on savings or Social Security.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that middle-class Americans are worried about the future of Social Security, which often fills the gap between retirees' savings and their financial needs. Broadly, 39% of those in the middle-class cohort said that one of their greatest fears in retirement was that Social Security would be reduced \u2014 or simply cease to exist \u2014 in the future.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe uncertain future of Social Security has long had older generations concerned. According to the latest Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees report, the program will only be able to pay out full benefits for the next 11 years \u2014 meaning that after that point, benefits will dwindle if Congress does not step in.\n\nThat's particularly troubling for Americans who have relied primarily on Social Security benefits to stay afloat financially in retirement. In a recent NerdWallet study of 2,100 adults, just 30% of respondents said they believe Social Security alone will allow them to live comfortably in retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne 63-year-old previously told Business Insider that she's \"incredibly scared\" Social Security won't be enough to cover her expenses. \"I think I'll probably need to work until I die because there's no money,\" she said.\n\nThe report also found that worries about Social Security are a primary reason some middle-class people plan to work after retirement. Of the 52% who plan to work after they retire, 55% plan to do so because of the extra income, while 33% are concerned Social Security benefits will be lower than expected.\n\nWith the presidential election quickly approaching, the fate of Social Security and Medicare is a hot-button issue for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. While Trump has vowed to protect benefits for older Americans, Democrats have accused the GOP of threatening to cut the benefits and raise the retirement age. The issue is likely to get more heated as November gets closer.\n\nAre you worried about outliving your retirement savings?

            "headline": "The Tech-Trump Alliance",
            "text": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nSome of the most prominent figures in Silicon Valley are enthusiastically supporting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. And Trump\u2019s running mate, J. D. Vance, is a former venture capitalist with deep ties to the right-wing tech billionaire Peter Thiel; as my colleague Ali Breland put it in a recent article, Silicon Valley \u201cgot their guy.\u201d I spoke with Ali, who covers tech and right-wing politics, about the long-simmering ideas animating Silicon Valley\u2019s shift to the right.\n\nReturning to Their Roots\n\nLora Kelley: Many people think of the Silicon Valley tech scene as a pretty liberal one. Is that assumption true? And if so, how did we get to this point where some of the most visible leaders in tech are backing Trump?\n\nAli Breland: There is a shift happening. I don\u2019t want to discount that. But this, to me, is also indicative of some segments of Silicon Valley returning to their roots.\n\nIf you look back at some of the original literature that was coming out of the tech scene\u2014the early issues of Wired magazine, or the Whole Earth Catalog\u2014they featured not necessarily hard-right ideologies but these free-market, libertarian ideologies. This kind of stuff was always flowing through Silicon Valley, even when tech executives were voting for and supporting Democrats. A lot of tech companies\u2019 business models involve finding ways to circumvent regulation and then hiring workforces that are not on staff or are extremely difficult to unionize.\n\nThe tech industry supported Democrats such as Barack Obama in part because he allowed that culture to exist within his version of liberalism. Tech titans perceive Kamala Harris and Joe Biden to be chipping away at that flexibility, so they\u2019re turning to a right that they see as more friendly to tech.\n\nLora: Is the selection of Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate hastening this turn?\n\nAli: Elon Musk was very excited when Trump picked Vance; he posted on X that the ticket \u201cresounds with victory.\u201d Some tech people seem to be feeling: He\u2019s one of us. He\u2019s connected to Peter Thiel. He worked out here. He believes in what we believe. There are certainly people coalescing around the campaign because of that.\n\nVance is where he is in large part because of Thiel\u2019s $15 million donation to his Senate campaign. Even though Thiel has said he isn\u2019t donating this cycle, the 2021 campaigns of Vance and Blake Masters were a warm-up moment. Venture capitalists were giving many millions more to the right than to Democrats in that cycle.\n\nLora: How pervasive is the support for Trump in Silicon Valley? Is the entire sector shifting? Or is it more that a few loud voices are getting lots of attention?\n\nAli: There are different factions. A lot of tech workers still skew left, or believe in a liberal version of the free market. And a lot of the tech-titan set are still Democrats: There\u2019s Aaron Levie of the software company Box; Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, is the mega Democratic donor of Silicon Valley; Sheryl Sandberg has publicly supported Kamala Harris.\n\nBut we are also seeing a group of right-backing tech titans expressing a new rhetoric that didn\u2019t have a place in Silicon Valley before. Thiel, for example, has been pushing his far-right beliefs into the ether for a long time. At one point, he was treated as an oddity. Now he\u2019s in step with the prevailing ideological movement among tech billionaires.\n\nLora: What are some of the ideas animating this new rhetoric?\n\nAli: In the techno-optimist manifesto that Marc Andreessen released last fall, he cites Nick Land, a British philosopher who became important in the intellectual development of the far right. He also cites F. T. Marinetti, who was an Italian futurist and fascist. And he quotes Friedrich Nietzsche, who is not inherently right-wing, but who is having a moment among this set of right-wing advocates of eugenics and a \u201cnatural order\u201d who want to see \u201cstrongmen\u201d take over, and who see feminists and the DEI movement as getting in the way of the country\u2019s true potential. I don\u2019t know if Andreessen believes in all of that. But that appeal to the strongman is indicative of the new right-wing thinking that\u2019s taking shape in Silicon Valley.\n\nLora: Some of this seems to be about ideology and values. But what are some of the more immediate policy concerns that are pushing tech titans toward the right?\n\nAli: A lot of tech leaders want to be left alone and unregulated. And there\u2019s lately been a shift in how the industry perceives Democrats to be approaching tech. Biden\u2019s appointment of Lina Khan, a proponent of stringent antitrust law, to lead the Federal Trade Commission is something tech people bring up a lot, and cite as an example of Biden not being interested in helping the industry. Even Andreessen has suggested that he misses the old Democrats who gave tech this cozy place and let them do what they want.\n\nThere is also a large crypto contingent that sees Biden as aggressively anti-crypto, and they\u2019re very skeptical of his appointment of Gary Gensler as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They\u2019re a bit more cautiously optimistic about Harris. But they still see Trump as the clearest path toward a low-regulation environment that\u2019s good for them.\n\nClearly, there is an aesthetic sensibility that crypto people appreciate about Trump, too. There\u2019s a troll-y aspect, and both Trump\u2019s MAGA base and the crypto community have ties to 4chan. Still, in past election cycles, crypto communities were not broadly pro-Trump, because there was no clear edge for them and their own material interests. Now some tech leaders see Trump as a way to satisfy those interests.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday\u2019s News\n\nThe U.S. Army said that an Arlington National Cemetery employee, who tried to ensure that Donald Trump\u2019s team adhered to the cemetery\u2019s rules against political activity during his recent visit, was \u201cabruptly pushed aside.\u201d An interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will air tonight on CNN. They answered questions about their plans for the White House, why Harris changed her position on decriminalizing illegal border crossings, and Trump\u2019s attacks on her racial identity.

Jetzt deutete er einen Sexskandal an.\n\nDonald Trump versucht weiter, mit derben Kommentaren die Aufmerksamkeit im US-Wahlkampf auf sich zu ziehen. Auf der von ihm mitbegr\u00fcndeten Plattform \"Truth Social\" waren Andeutungen zu lesen, wonach sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten die politische Karriere von Kamala Harris bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten.\n\nAnspielungen auf Sex-Skandal von Bill Clinton\n\nIn dem Post des republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Harris zu sehen, auf dem sie neben der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton steht. Dazu der Kommentar: \"Lustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben ...\"\n\nDie Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sexskandal, in den Clintons Mann und Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 bis 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Die Andeutungen sind in dem Post nicht mit Quellen belegt, werden aber dennoch von Trump-Anh\u00e4ngern geteilt.\n\nTrump verfasste den Beitrag nicht selbst. Dass er ihn auf seinem offiziellen Truth-Social-Account verbreitete, ist dennoch bemerkenswert. Der Republikaner verunglimpft seine demokratische Gegnerin im Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Unter anderem bezeichnet er sie als \"verr\u00fcckt\" und \"dumm\".\n\nTrump hat Harris auch schon mit Blick auf ihre Hautfarbe und Herkunft attackiert und unter anderem behauptet, die 59-J\u00e4hrige sei \"vor einigen Jahren pl\u00f6tzlich schwarz\" geworden. Verbale Angriffe sexueller Art haben eine neue Qualit\u00e4t.\n\nBei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Chicago kommentierte Trump die Hautfarbe von Kamala Harris.\n\nImmer wieder pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe - trotz Mahnungen\n\nMehrere Republikaner hatten Trump zuletzt \u00f6ffentlich dazu geraten, weniger pers\u00f6nliche Attacken gegen Harris von sich zu geben, sondern mehr inhaltliche Punkte zu machen. Trump wurde k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Pressekonferenz auf diese Mahnungen angesprochen, tat solche Ratschl\u00e4ge jedoch ab.\n\n\"Ich glaube, ich habe ein Recht darauf, sie pers\u00f6nlich zu attackieren\", sagte der 78-J\u00e4hrige mit Blick auf Harris und den Wahlkampf und schob nach: \"Ich muss es auf meine Art machen.\"\n\nSchon im Wahlkampf 2016 hatte Trump mit einer vulg\u00e4ren Aussage f\u00fcr Furore gesorgt, dass er Frauen \u00fcberall anfassen k\u00f6nne, auch zwischen den Beinen. Die Amerikaner w\u00e4hlten ihn damals trotzdem zum Pr\u00e4sidenten."

In court papers, Special Counsel Jack Smith said this latest action was an effort to respect and implement the Supreme Court holdings. The new charges specify when prosecutors think Trump was acting as a candidate seeking political office and not as the President. If he wins the election in November, Trump could order the Justice Department to dismiss the case. If he loses, Johnson says all the legal wrangling could get even more intense.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo members of Trump\u2019s campaign staff had a verbal and physical altercation with an official at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday while Trump was attending a ceremony honoring 13 troops killed in Afghanistan in 2021.

You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.\n\nEarlier this year, Donald Trump's social media company was worth something like $9 billion.\n\nBut that was then, and its stock has been sinking since: Now investors think Trump Media & Technology Group Corp \u2014 the company that runs Truth Social, Trump's Twitter clone \u2014 is worth a mere $4 billion. Today its stock closed at just above $20 a share, the lowest it has been since the company had its equivalent of an IPO in March.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nTo start, a caveat we've mentioned before: DJT is a meme stock. Investors aren't valuing it based on the company's financials, which are very meager at best. They think it's worth something because other people think it's worth something, and that collective fantasy will work right up until it doesn't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo trying to figure out why DJT is moving up or down on any given day isn't likely to lead to a satisfactory answer. Mostly you're going to get something along these lines: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nStill. We can at least acknowledge that DJT has been sliding for quite some time. So there's something going on.\n\nOne reason Trump's stock may be moving down is that lots of people who own Trump stock are Trump fans, and/or people betting that Trump will win the November election. But it has been harder to be in one of those groups recently: Since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden as Trump's opponent, Trump has been losing ground in the polls, and now both The New York Times and pollster Nate Silver see him as a slight underdog.\n\nSo if DJT is a proxy for Trump's election chances, it would make sense that it has been limping recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other very plausible reason that Trump stock is moving down is that investors may be worried about Trump selling some of his shares in the company. This could lead to other investors selling, which would have a cascading effect on the share price.\n\nTrump currently owns about 60% of Truth Social, which means his stake is worth about $2.4 billion. He's been restricted from selling any shares because of a lock-up restriction, which are common in public offerings. But the lock-up period could end as soon as September 20 \u2014 hence people trying to get out of the stock before he does.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere are two arguments against that theory, by the way: The first is that the lock-up period has been public knowledge since Truth Social first went public, so why bail now? The second is that Trump knows that if he does sell stock \u2014 and particularly if he sells a lot of stock \u2014 that the stock will really collapse. Because all but the most die-hard Trump fans will see it as the end of the company.\n\nSo there's a real tension there: Does Trump keep his theoretical $2.4 billion stake intact? Or does he try to turn it into actual money, and risk making the overall value much less?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any case, it's possible that both of the ideas above \u2014 Trump's declining political fortune, and the idea that he may be ready to trigger a big sell-off himself \u2014 are true. Or maybe there's something else at work that we have yet to see.\n\nThe only thing we know for certain is that if you bought Trump stock in late March and haven't sold it since then, you are down by more than 50%. We don't give investment advice around here. But don't say we didn't warn you."

            "text": "From the Gaza war to immigration to inflation, Harris is yet to spell out how she will accomplish her agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris will sit down for her first major broadcast interview since she became the face of the Democratic Party following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nShe will be joined by her running mate, Tim Walz, for the interview with CNN.\n\nUntil now, Harris has taken a cautious approach towards the press, much like Biden, who has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than any of the past seven US presidents, Axios reported, citing presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar.\n\nHarris\u2019s own sparse engagement with the media has come under scrutiny, especially from the Republicans. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to do a news conference; she\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Republican challenger Donald Trump said during a news conference of his own on August 15.\n\nTo be sure, Harris has spoken on several key issues that polls suggest matter to American voters, in campaign rallies and policy speeches. But without the cross-questioning that an interview allows, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee\u2019s positions on critical subjects remain ambiguous.\n\nSo when is the interview and what are some of the questions Harris has yet to clearly answer?\n\nWhen is Harris\u2019s CNN interview?\n\nHarris will speak to CNN\u2019s anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash alongside the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, at 9pm (01:00 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t be silent\u2019 on Gaza: How will she speak up?\n\nOn July 26, following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, Harris pledged not to stay silent on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,\u201d she told reporters. Yet, simultaneously, she pledged unwavering commitment to Israel.\n\n''I have had an unwavering commitment to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel.'' US VP Kamala Harris says she expressed her 'serious concerns' to Israeli PM Netanyahu about the 'scale of human suffering in Gaza.' pic.twitter.com/1U0KErqiDL \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 26, 2024\n\nIn the month since she made this statement, however, Harris\u2019s relative silence on Gaza has come under fire from critics who have questioned whether Harris\u2019s policy on Israel\u2019s war will be any different from Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo far, the answer, many believe, seems to be a firm no.\n\nAmid speculation that she might at least consider using restrictions on arms sales to Israel as leverage to convince the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop massacres of Palestinians, her adviser on national security made clear that Harris had no such plans.\n\n\u201cShe does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\u201d Phil Gordon, the adviser, said on August 8.\n\n.@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law. \u2014 Phil Gordon (@PhilGordon46) August 8, 2024\n\nAt this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which was held from August 19 to August 22 in Chicago, Harris once again simultaneously pledged support for Israel and expressed sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the Democrats refused to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the convention, while the parents of an Israeli-American captive held in Gaza were allowed to take the stage.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters rallied outside the DNC venue on all three days but were blocked from marching too close to the venue by police. Many warned that they would not support Harris in the November vote unless she ends unconditional support for Israel.\n\nHow will she ban \u2018price gouging\u2019?\n\nOn August 16, Harris proposed a ban on \u201cprice gouging\u201d by food suppliers and grocery stores.\n\nPrice gouging refers to dramatically raising prices to \u201cunfair levels\u201d in response to short-term high demand or scarcity \u2013 often following disasters, such as flooding. While several states already restrict the practice for some goods considered essential, there is no federal law barring it.\n\nThe proposal could be popular. High grocery bill inflation is a key concern for many voters. Under Biden\u2019s administration, grocery prices have gone up by 21 percent as part of an inflation surge.\n\nBut Harris has not spelt out how exactly she would go about enacting this ban on price gouging, earning her backlash from political critics, as well as industry.\n\nIn a release last week, the Trump campaign called her plan an example of \u201ccommunist price controls\u201d.\n\nIndustrialists and economists also said the plan could do more harm than good.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan is vague, but a central part of it involves getting the US Congress to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging in food and grocery sectors, similar to legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last year.\n\nYet political analysts point out that such legislation has almost no chance of passing in Congress \u2014 raising questions about the sincerity of Harris\u2019s proposal.\n\nWill she build a border wall?\n\nHarris has flip-flopped on the topic of immigration.\n\nDuring the DNC, she pledged that she would sign the now-defunct bipartisan border security bill that Trump wanted to terminate out of fears that it would benefit Democrats.\n\nThis bill would have allocated $20m towards security measures at the southern border with Mexico. The bill also set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for the construction of a border wall that was a signature project undertaken by Trump, and criticised by many Democrats.\n\nIndeed, during Trump\u2019s administration, Harris had called the idea of the wall \u201cun-American\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, she wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won\u2019t make us any safer.\u201d\n\nWhen she declared her candidacy for her 2020 presidential race in 2019, she called the wall Trump\u2019s \u201cmedieval vanity project\u201d.\n\nBesides pledging support for the bill that funds the wall, there are other indicators of Harris\u2019s hardening stance on immigration, including campaign advertisements in which she supports the idea of more Border Patrol agents.\n\nThis shift comes amid efforts by Republicans to hold Harris responsible for a surge in undocumented migrants into the US, by describing her as Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nNEW AD: On the border, the choice is simple. Kamala Harris is fighting to fix our broken immigration system. Donald Trump is trying to stop her. pic.twitter.com/t200w8iAYv \u2014 Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 30, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s her position on Medicare for All?\n\nWhen Harris was a senator for California, she signed on as a co-sponsor for Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All legislation which called for a single-payer health insurance system to provide everyone in the US with comprehensive healthcare.\n\nHowever, Harris\u2019s economic plan this time is silent on Medicare for All. So, it is unclear if she still backs the idea or has dropped it entirely.\n\nWill Harris ban fracking?\n\nDuring her 2019 primary run, Harris had also pledged to ban fracking \u2013 the controversial technique of extracting oil and gas from shale rock by drilling the earth.\n\nThe practice causes earth tremors and has a high environmental cost since the procedure consumes large amounts of water, in addition to releasing methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nHowever, Harris seems to have taken a U-turn on fracking during her presidential campaign this year. In late July, her campaign officials confirmed that she will not seek to ban fracking if elected.\n\nTrump had invoked her 2019 anti-fracking stance to criticise her.\n\nThe Biden administration allowed fracking. Harris herself has not made a public statement about whether or not she will ban fracking if she rises to the top job."

A group that supports Kamala Harris for president says Mr Kennedy's alleged removal and transportation of the skull of the whale may have broken the law. Mr Kennedy, 70, has not commented on the incident, detailed by his daughter in an interview 12 years ago. The call for an investigation comes days after he suspended his independent presidential campaign, which was marked by strange twists including his confession that he once dumped the body of a dead bear in New York's Central Park.\n\nMr Kennedy has now endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, and has been offered a place on the Republican candidate's transition team if he is elected. The incident with the whale's head, which dates to around 1994, was recounted by Kathleen \"Kick\" Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country magazine. Mr Kennedy, who is said to enjoy studying animal skulls and skeletons, reportedly heard that the dead animal had washed up in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where the family was staying. He went to the beach to cut off the head with a chainsaw, and then proceeded to tie it to the roof of the family minivan with bungee cords. The family then drove back to their home in New York, Ms Kennedy said. \"Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,\" Ms Kennedy told the magazine. \"We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.\" RFK Jr just endorsed Trump. Will it matter in November?\n\nAnalysis: Dead bear another strange twist in RFK Jr's campaign The call for an investigation was made by the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, which has publicly endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for president. The group wrote a letter to set out their case to marine protection officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The letter, quoted by US media, said Mr Kennedy may have broken multiple federal laws by collecting wildlife body parts and transporting them across state lines. \u201cVital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists,\" the group's political director Brett Hartl wrote. \"This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study,\u201d Mr Hartl added. Noaa confirmed to the BBC that it received the letter and was compiling a response. Mr Kennedy has not confirmed receipt of the letter. The BBC has approached his campaign for comment.\n\nUS election: RFK Jr drops presidential campaign and supports Donald Trump\n\nAt one point earlier this year, Mr Kennedy averaged about 15% in presidential preference polls as an independent candidate. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions, environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. But his numbers dwindled, and he announced last week he was suspending his campaign. Although he initially competed to win the Democratic nomination, he ended up criticising his former party and offering his endorsement to Donald Trump. The move dismayed his relatives, who are the most famous family in Democratic politics. Mr Kennedy's campaign attracted a range of bizarre and scandalous headlines. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. \u201cI have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,\u201d he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of \u201cgarbage\u201d but conceded that he had a \u201cvery, very rambunctious youth\u201d and that he was \u201cnot a church boy\u201d. Earlier this month, Mr Kennedy was filmed talking to actress Roseanne Barr, recounting the 2014 incident with the dead bear cub. He said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving in a rural area, and he put it in his van with the initial intention of harvesting its meat. But ultimately he thought it would be \"amusing\" to leave the carcass in New York's Central Park, to make it appear that an errant cyclist had killed the animal. The bear was found the following day. Responding to a BBC request for comment, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation said charges could not be brought for incidents more than a year old."

No economist on earth will support it, strategist says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the U.S., and implementing his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports would make inflation surge, according to a Nobel-prize winning economist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Trump were actually able to get his agenda through, it would be a disaster,\u201d Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Bill Clinton, told Quartz in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStiglitz, who more recently was head of the International Economic Association, said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201chas been a very steady hand with a set of well-talked-through proposals from the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrump every other day changes his mind about something,\u201d Stiglitz said, arguing that Trump\u2019s planned 50% tariffs on Chinese goods would slam lower- and middle-income Americans. \u201cThose tariffs would create a significant increase in the cost of living, it would be a shock to the economy, and that inflation, in turn, would lead the Fed to raise interest rates.\u201d\n\nReducing America\u2019s dependence on China can\u2019t be done with a sledgehammer, Stiglitz said. \u201cThe Biden-Harris proposal for a 10% tariff is an important signal to the market: \u2018You\u2019d better think about diversifying your supply chain.\u2019 And that, I would call good economic management. Good economic policy is balancing multiple concerns, and that kind of balancing is what distinguishes Harris from Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the specifics of Harris\u2019 plans, from boosting the child tax credit to planning to build three million new homes, Stiglitz said \u201cthe bundle as a whole is moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThose are cumulative problems that have been unattended for 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand so you\u2019re not going to be able to solve them overnight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 plans would also address the growth of monopolies, which have been holding back U.S. innovation and driving prices higher, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the weaknesses in the U.S. economy over the past 20 years has been a significant growth in market power, and that increase in market power reduces innovation, increases inequality, and lowers real wages of ordinary Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been one aspect of [the Biden-Harris] economic policy that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Trump and Harris lies in their tax policies.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 [Trump tax cut] was an enormous tax cut for the millionaires, and actually a tax increase when it was fully implemented for a large fraction of Americans,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWhat we need to do is restore tax justice, increase the taxes on the billionaires who can obviously afford it, and help address some of the big problems of inequality that we have, like child poverty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s move to cut the corporate income tax from 28% to to 21% did nothing to improve U.S. competitiveness, it just increased stock buybacks, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cExtending [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and making them deeper would make a huge hole in the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, the reason why they expired in 2025 was because the deficit created by the tax bill was so large that even Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe irony of his policies is that while a lot of support for them may come from people who feel like the system has left them behind,\u201d Siglitz added, \u201chis proposal will leave them even more behind.\u201d"

Auf Truth Social Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet bezeichnete Trump Harris\u2018 Antworten als \u201ezusammenhangloses Gerede\u201c, als sie von CNN-Moderatorin Dana Bash auf ihre fr\u00fcheren politischen Kehrtwendungen angesprochen wurde.\n\nAnzeige\n\nHarris\u2018 Erkl\u00e4rung, dass sich ihre \u201eWerte nicht ge\u00e4ndert haben\u201c, nahm Trump aufs Korn: \u201eDem stimme ich zu, ihre Werte haben sich nicht ge\u00e4ndert.\u201c Und f\u00fchrt fort: \u201eDie Grenze wird offen bleiben, es wird eine kostenlose Gesundheitsversorgung f\u00fcr illegale Einwanderer geben, ein Verbot von benzinbetriebenen Autos, die private Gesundheitsversorgung wird abgeschafft.\u201c Er warnte weiter, dass unter einer Pr\u00e4sidentschaft von Harris Amerika zu einem Brachland (\u201eWasteland\u201c) werden w\u00fcrde. 04:16 Uhr \u2013 Harris: Werde Fracking nicht verbieten \u201eAls Pr\u00e4sidentin werde ich Fracking nicht verbieten\u201c, sagte Kamala Harris in einem am Donnerstagabend (Ortszeit) ausgestrahlten Interview des Nachrichtensenders CNN.\n\nAnzeige\n\nIm Wahlkampf 2020 hatte die Vizepr\u00e4sidentin der USA noch gesagt, dass sie die umstrittene Praktik zur F\u00f6rderung von \u00d6l und Erdgas verbieten wolle.

Kennedy bei der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl am 5. November im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat North Carolina auf den Stimmzetteln stehen. Die dortige Wahlaufsicht lehnte am Donnerstag einen Antrag seiner Partei We The People ab, Kennedys Namen von den Stimmzetteln zu streichen.

US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin habe einem entsprechenden Hilfeersuchen des Heimatschutzministeriums zugestimmt, teilte Pentagon-Sprecherin Sabrina Singh mit. Austin habe den Befehlshaber des n\u00f6rdlichen US-Kommandos angewiesen, die Unterst\u00fctzung des f\u00fcr den Schutz der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten und ihre Stellvertreter zust\u00e4ndigen Secret Service zu verst\u00e4rken. Dies gelte auch f\u00fcr den gew\u00e4hlten Pr\u00e4sidenten und seinen Stellvertreter nach der Wahl am 5.

Die Buhrufe im Publikum ert\u00f6nten gleich zu Beginn des Auftritts des Senatos, andere Zuschauer applaudierten allerdings auch. \u201eKlingt so, als h\u00e4tten wir einige Fans und einige Hasser\u201c, sagte der 40-J\u00e4hrige bei der Konferenz in der Ostk\u00fcsten-Metropole Boston. \u201eDas ist in Ordnung. H\u00f6ren Sie sich an, was ich zu sagen habe, und ich werde meinen Standpunkt darlegen\u201c, so Vance weiter. 15:21 Uhr \u2013 Plattenfirma verbietet Trump, Abba-Songs auf Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu spielen\n\n\u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre Karrieren ausgewirkt haben\u201c, sagt Trump \u00fcber Clinton und Harris Die US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin der Demokraten, Kamala Harris, gibt zusammen mit Vizekandidat Tim Walz ihr erstes TV-Interview. Unterdessen geht Donald Trump einmal mehr unter die G\u00fcrtellinie. Erik Kirschbaum fasst die Ereignisse zusammen.\n\nDie Plattenfirma von ABBA fordert den US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Donald Trump auf, die zahlreichen Hits der schwedischen Kultband nicht mehr bei seinen Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu verwenden. Universal Music in Schweden teilte der Nachrichtenagentur AFP in einer E-Mail mit, auf Videos sei zu sehen, dass die Musik von ABBA bei mindestens einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung des Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten gespielt worden sei. \u201eWir haben verlangt, dass es heruntergenommen und entfernt wird\u201c, hie\u00df es \u00fcber das Material. Die Plattenfirma hob hervor, dass sie nicht um Erlaubnis f\u00fcr die Nutzung der ABBA-Songs gebeten worden sei.

Sie f\u00fchrt laut der am Donnerstag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Umfrage mit einer Zustimmung von 45 Prozent vor Trump mit 41 Prozent. Die Erhebung wurde in den vergangenen acht Tagen bis Mittwoch vorgenommen. In einer Umfrage von Reuters/Ipsos von Ende Juli hatte Harris bei registrierten W\u00e4hlern mit nur einem Prozentpunkt vor Trump gelegen. Die neue Umfrage hat eine Fehlerquote von zwei Prozent.

Damit legte sie im Vergleich zur letzten Erhebung im Juli bei beiden Gruppen weiter zu. Trump lag dagegen bei wei\u00dfen W\u00e4hlern und M\u00e4nnern unver\u00e4ndert vorn. Es sei offensichtlich, dass das Rennen gegen Harris f\u00fcr Trump eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung sei als der Wahlkampf gegen Biden, sagte der republikanische Wahlkampf-Experte Matt Wolking. Doch sei Harris f\u00fcr Trump \u201enicht un\u00fcberwindlich\u201c. Trump m\u00fcsse vor allem darauf achten, W\u00e4hler nun nicht zu verschrecken, die in der Vergangenheit zu ihm tendierten, weil sie Biden ablehnten. 14:00 Uhr \u2013 Pressesprecher von J.D. Vance soll Verbindungen zu Rechtsextremen haben Parker Magid, der neue Pressesprecher des republikanischen Vizekandidaten J.D. Vance, hat f\u00fcr eine Beraterfirma gearbeitet, die tief verflochten mit neurechten und rechtsextremen Think-Tanks sein soll. Das berichtet der \u201eGuadrian\u201c Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet . So soll die Beraterfirma Beck & Stone fundamentale Christen unterst\u00fctzen und der \u201eSociety for American Civic Renewal\u201c nahestehen, einer Geheimloge der Far-Right-Bewegung. Einer Extremismusforscherin zufolge, die der \u201eGuardian\u201c zitiert, handelt es sich bei den mit der Beraterfirma verwobenen Organisationen um solche, die in ihren Ansichten \u00fcber den konventionellen Konservatismus weit hinausgehen. 10:23 Uhr \u2013 Fotos von deutscher Influencerin von Pro-Trump-Accounts benutzt Pro-Trump-Accounts im Online-Dienst X bedienen sich bei Social-Media-Fotos von 17 europ\u00e4ischen Frauen. Das berichtet der US-Sender CNN. Auch mindestens eine Deutsche sei betroffen. Dies habe eine Untersuchung in Kooperation mit dem Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) ergeben. Die benutzten Fotos seien auf X-Profilen ausgespielt worden, die offenbar Teil einer koordinierten Kampagne waren, welche das Trump-Vance-Lager vor den Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen unterst\u00fctzen sollte. Laut CNN-Bericht zeigt eine Analyse dutzender Pro-Trump-Konten ein systematisches Muster von \u201enicht authentischem Verhalten\u201c. Alle Konten w\u00fcrden gestohlene oder manipulierte Fotos von jungen Frauen zeigen, die ihre Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Trump in Posts erkl\u00e4rten und Hashtags wie #MAGAPatriots oder #MAGA2024 verwendeten. Die Bilder seien oftmals manipuliert worden, um auf der Kleidung Trump-Slogans zu platzieren. Es gebe keinen Hinweis darauf, dass Trump und sein Team involviert waren.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl 2024 Dumm vs. d\u00fcmmer \u2013 Harris und Trump \u00fcberbieten sich mit \u00f6konomischer Ahnungslosigkeit\n\nEiner der Fake-Accounts, der im CNN-Artikel genannt wird, hei\u00dft @Luna_2K24.

Trump teilte auf der von ihm mit begr\u00fcndeten Plattform Truth Social den Beitrag eines anderen Nutzers, der andeutete, dass sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten Harris\u2018 politische Karriere bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten. In dem Post ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Kamala Harris zu sehen an der Seite der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton, die 2016 im Wahlkampf gegen Trump angetreten war. Dazu der Kommentar: \u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben...\u201c\n\nDie derbe Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sex-Skandal, in den Clintons Mann Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 \u2013 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Trump-Unterst\u00fctzer wiederum verbreiten v\u00f6llig unbelegte Behauptungen \u00fcber Harris, wonach die romantische Beziehung zu einem einflussreichen Politiker in Kalifornien in den 90er Jahren ihrer Karriere geholfen habe. 00:11 Uhr \u2013 Trump-Team \u00e4u\u00dfert sich zu Vorfall auf Soldatenfriedhof Donald Trump hatte am Montag auf dem Friedhof nahe der US-Hauptstadt Washington bei einer Kranzniederlegung der vor drei Jahren bei einem Selbstmordanschlag in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten US-Soldaten gedacht. Auch einige Familienmitglieder der Opfer waren anwesend. Nun wurde bekannt, dass es bei der Visite zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen Trumps Team und Mitarbeitern des Friedhofs kam. Kritiker warfen dem republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Trump vor, er habe seinen Besuch f\u00fcr Wahlkampfzwecke missbraucht. Seine Kampagne wies das zur\u00fcck. Die US-Rundfunkorganisation NPR berichtete, zwei Trump-Mitarbeiter h\u00e4tten bei dem Besuch einen Mitarbeiter des Friedhofs beschimpft und zur Seite geschubst, als dieser Film- und Fotoaufnahmen auf einem bestimmten Teil des Gel\u00e4ndes habe unterbinden wollen. Ein Trump-Sprecher schreibt nun auf der Plattform X, ein Fotograf sei zugelassen gewesen. In einer Stellungnahme f\u00fcr NPR erkl\u00e4rte dieser weiter, der Friedhofsmitarbeiter habe wohl \u201ean einer psychischen St\u00f6rung\u201c gelitten und sich Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams physisch in den Weg gestellt.\n\nTrumps Wahlkampfteam ver\u00f6ffentlichte auf X au\u00dferdem eine Stellungnahme von Angeh\u00f6rigen der in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten Soldaten, die dem Republikaner f\u00fcr seinen Besuch dankten. Sie h\u00e4tten der Teilnahme eines Fotografen zugestimmt, und das Verhalten von Trump und dessen Team sei von gr\u00f6\u00dftem Respekt gepr\u00e4gt gewesen. Mittwoch, 28.

            "text": "The official J.D. Vance Bad Press Tour keeps on rolling this week, as the Republican vice presidential hopeful faces scrutiny over 2021 comments he made bashing teachers without biological children, including American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten.\n\nAlready grappling with widespread backlash over another 2021 jab calling Democratic politicians and voters \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d Vance now must answer more questions about further comments he made during an October 2021 political event for the Center for Christian Virtue. \u201cSo many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they\u2019re people without kids trying to brainwash the minds of our children. That really disorients me and disturbs me,\u201d Vance said during the event. \u201cRandi Weingarten, who\u2019s the head of the most powerful teachers\u2019 union in the country, she doesn\u2019t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\u201d\n\nWeingarten is a lesbian, and introduced the public to her wife, Liz Margolies, in 2007. Vance\u2019s disparaging remarks, however, were also inaccurate: Weingarten, believed to be the first openly LGBTQ+ president of a major U.S. labor union, is stepmother to Margolies\u2019 biological children, and described herself as a \u201cmother by marriage\u201d last year when subjected to similar attacks on her motherhood by Vance\u2019s GOP colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nStill, Vance doubled down on, and falsely reframed, his own remarks while being interviewed on the tarmac outside the Trump-Vance campaign jet this week, as CNN reported. \u201cI didn\u2019t criticize Randi Weingarten for not having kids, I criticized her for wanting to brainwash mine,\u201d Vance claimed. Meanwhile, Weingarten responded in an MSNBC interview, calling his comments \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d\n\nA Viral Image Appears to Show Virulently Anti-LGBTQ+ VP Candidate J.D. Vance in Drag Content creator and podcast host Matt Bernstein posted the image to X and Instagram over the weekend.\n\nVance has not specifically stated in what way he believes Weingarten is \u201cbrainwashing\u201d his children. His statement at the Center for Christian Virtue event was made in the general context of \u201cthe ideology of the left,\u201d which Vance characterized as \u201ccontrol[ling] what our children learn.\u201d Similarly vague, yet apocalyptic, rhetoric about Weingarten and the AFT has proliferated on the right over the last several years. In a 2022 interview, former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Weingarten \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d and alleged that teachers\u2019 unions are \u201cthe most likely to take this republic down.\u201d Other Republican lines of attack have included the accusation that Weingarten and the AFT puppeteered the U.S.\u2019 COVID-19 policy, which Weingarten flatly denied and called \u201cwild allegations.\u201d"

            "headline": "Kamala\u2019s Moment",
            "text": "The Precise Time Department sounds like something from a story by Jorge Luis Borges, but it is a real subdivision of the US Navy. At the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris has her official residence, the department maintains the Master Clock with which all others in the military system are harmonized. At the end of the driveway that leads from the vice-president\u2019s house, there is a public display of these exact hours, minutes, and seconds set beside a huge ship\u2019s anchor, as though this superaccurate chronometer served to hold America steady and prevent it from coming unmoored. Such reassurance seems, of course, ever more illusory.\n\nThere is a melancholy evocation of the Master Clock and its merciless motions at the start of Promise Me, Dad (2017), Joe Biden\u2019s account of his public and private lives in 2014. Biden was then living at the Naval Observatory as vice-president to Barack Obama. Leaving the residence for his family\u2019s annual Thanksgiving gathering in Nantucket, he seemed momentarily mesmerized:\n\nI glanced at the squat, standing digital clock at the top of the driveway, as I had maybe a thousand times since we had moved into the official residence. Red numbers glowed, ticking away in metronomic perfection: 5:11:42, 5:11:43, 5:11:44, 5:11:45\u2026. Precise Time\u2014synchronized to the millisecond\u2014had been deemed an operational imperative by the Department of Defense, which had troops and bases in locations around the globe. 5:11:50, 5:11:51, 5:11:52.\n\nOur limousine was already accelerating out of the turn with an abrupt force that pushed me back into the soft leather seats. The clock was behind us in a flash, out of sight, but still marking the time as it melted away\u20145:11:58, 5:11:59, 5:12:00.\n\nFor Biden, time was melting away. He did not get to be his party\u2019s nominee for president in 2016, and that in turn meant that he would be too old to stand for a second term in 2024. Hard as he tried, he could not, in the end, escape the clock\u2019s relentless indifference to his desire to stay in power. But for Harris, the glowing red numbers that haunted Biden may mark the precise time. They have hurried her to a moment not just of personal destiny but of historic fate.\n\nHarris\u2019s rapid coronation as the Democratic candidate for the presidency is at once quite fortuitous and utterly timely. It might be called an accident that\u2019s been waiting to happen. An accident because were it not for a series of unprecedented events\u2014Biden\u2019s becoming the oldest president in US history, his disintegration in a live televised debate, Donald Trump\u2019s political resurgence after an attempted coup and personal resurrection after an attempted assassination\u2014neither she nor any other Black woman would have become the candidate of either of the two main parties. The time, in conventional wisdom, would not have been right. The voters would not have been ready. The clock would have to tick on through endless cycles before the day arrived when it would feel safe to have, at the top of the ticket, an embodiment of American power that was neither white nor male.\n\nAnd yet it was an accident waiting to happen because this conventional wisdom is itself out of sync with a nation in which white men make up just 30 percent of the population. This is the minority that benefits from a spectacular application of positive discrimination in the political sphere: it accounts for close to two thirds of officeholders. By contrast, only three Black women\u2014Shirley Chisholm in 1972, Carol Moseley Braun in 2004, and Harris in 2020\u2014have previously even sought a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and only three (including Harris) have served in the Senate. No Black woman has been elected as a governor, and only twenty-five have held other senior statewide offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, or secretary of state.\n\nTime shapes contemporary American politics in two additional ways\u2014anachronism and gerontocracy. Biden, because of who he is, seemed to embody both the superannuated nature of America\u2019s political class and its overrepresentation of white men of the baby boomer generation. Harris, because of who she is, is uniquely placed to call time on both these realities\u2014which means, first of all, calling time on Donald Trump. If she frames her campaign effectively, Harris can make Trump a throwback and herself the embodiment of a future that has already taken shape in American demography.\n\nThat campaign can and must be about the things that affect people\u2019s daily lives\u2014jobs, health care, education, the climate crisis. But ticking away underneath it is another kind of question: Who is a normal American now? Harris\u2019s choice of running mate suggests she is aware of this: the avuncular Minnesota governor Tim Walz has a gift for making progressive ideals seem familiar, ordinary, and rooted in down-home common sense. Meanwhile, Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, implicitly appeal to a more symbolic notion of representation: however complex and diverse American society might seem to be, its essential form is male, white, and at least culturally Christian. This has always been so in the past and must always be so in the future. If demography, and therefore democracy, is flowing away from this eternal truth, then democracy must be frozen in time. When Trump told a right-wing Christian audience on July 26 that if they vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d they \u201cwon\u2019t have to do it anymore,\u201d he was putting forward his own notion of the end of history. The changes that are making the US more ethnically diverse, less comfortably patriarchal, and less Christian will be permanently checked because the institutions of power will have been made safe from their effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the problem with Biden\u2019s candidacy was that, for vastly more benign reasons, it drew on a parallel idea of holding back a tide of change. Biden presented himself, not without reason, as a bulwark, the only immovable object that could stop the apparently unstoppable Trump. As the Democratic candidate, Harris has rightly taken up Biden\u2019s message that the election in November is, as the outgoing president put it in his address from the Oval Office on July 24, about \u201csaving our democracy.\u201d But her candidacy carries a much stronger resonance. It says that saving American democracy is not at all the same thing as preserving it.\n\nBiden used the metaphor made famous by John F. Kennedy when he became, at forty-three, the second-youngest president in US history: \u201cI\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\u201d But the torch of American democracy must be envisaged as a flickering flame. In her rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, Hillary Clinton spoke of how \u201cevery generation has carried the torch forward.\u201d It is not a secure and fixed inheritance that can be handed down as a bequest from one generation to the next. It is a dangerous and endangered idea that must always draw fuel from new sources. American democracy cannot be saved if it is not reimagined, deepened, expanded, and brought into line with contemporary American realities. It is open to Harris to embody the energy of that urgent updating. Indeed, she can scarcely do otherwise.\n\nIt would be good to live in a world where Harris\u2019s gender and ethnicity were irrelevant and where she was judged solely on her record and ideas. But if there is any such world, it does not include the US. Trump, Vance, and the Republican Party will not permit such a possibility. Their reactionary mindset is obsessed with human biology\u2014Harris, for them, is inescapably defined by her chromosomes. The idea of the reproduction of America through the generations is projected onto her body. So far as we know, none of the forty-five occupants to date of the Oval Office has given birth to a child\u2014but in Harris\u2019s case this nonevent is a neglect of biological duty that makes her, in Vance\u2019s words, one of the \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d who don\u2019t \u201chave a direct stake\u201d in the country\u2019s future. The point of this contention is precisely that it is a claim on the future. Tomorrow belongs to Vance and those who look and think like him.\n\nHarris does, of course, have children through her marriage to Doug Emhoff, but because she did not give birth to them, Vance cited her first among the ranks of \u201cpeople without children.\u201d This, crucially, excludes her from the norm and indeed makes her the prime example of those who \u201chate normal Americans for choosing family.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that Harris has failed to give birth; it is also that she has failed to be properly born. John Eastman, a coconspirator in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 election, sought the Republican nomination for California attorney general in 2010, the year Harris won that office. In August 2020 Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman protesting that \u201cbefore we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris\u2019 eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth.\u201d He claimed (on spurious constitutional grounds) that since (as he thought) Harris\u2019s parents were in the United States on temporary visas when she was born in October 1964, she\n\nowed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers\u2014Jamaica, in the case of her father, and India, in the case of her mother\u2014and was therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment as originally understood.\n\nAt the time Trump amplified this bogus allegation, describing Eastman as a \u201cvery highly qualified, very talented lawyer\u201d and remarking that\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI heard it today that she doesn\u2019t meet the requirements\u2026. I have no idea if that\u2019s right, I would\u2019ve\u2014I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026very serious.\n\nOn August 19, as the Democratic convention was opening, Trump returned to this theme, asking of the Democrats: \u201cI wonder if they knew where she comes from.\u201d In this upending of the idea of birthright, Harris has no right to be American because she was born wrong. If there\u2019s a genre underpinning the Republican disdain for Harris, it\u2019s a nativity play that has become a horror movie. In Eastman\u2019s narrative, she was already, at the very moment of her birth, a traitor to America, loyal to two foreign powers. According to Vance\u2019s rhetoric, this misbegotten woman has grown up to be the potential begetter of a sterile American future.\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been attacked with both these biological weapons. Barack Obama had to face down Trump\u2019s birther lies but not the other natalist assault as well. No one said he hated ordinary Americans because he had not brought his own pregnancy to term. Yet it is the very unprecedented nature of this double assault on her bodily being that also gives Harris an exceptional power. She knows how to deal with this stuff\u2014she has been doing so all her life, with considerable grace.\n\nIt seems telling that Trump has had to abandon his mocking nickname for her, Laffin\u2019 Kamala, presumably because of a belated realization that her laughter\u2014so different from his own cruel comedy\u2014seems to most people to express optimism, youthfulness, and a joy in life, all qualities that he (as well as Biden) so patently lacks. She politicizes the idea of being comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. And in that comfort, there is a paradoxical kind of potency. She can be extremely radical by presenting herself merely as what she is. For if Harris really is a \u201cnormal American\u201d (as of course she is), it can only be because the American norm has been transformed. It can be possible because the torch has already been passed not just to a new generation but to new forms of personal and collective self-definition.\n\nHarris is fluent in a kind of baby talk very different from the demented babble of the Republican assaults on her. She does not run from the politicization of her body\u2014she embraces it. She is, in the way she tells her own story, a child of struggle. In her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey (2019), the earliest memory she recounts is of \u201ca sea of legs moving about, of the energy and shouts and chants.\u201d She gives us an infant\u2019s-eye view of political activism, with her looking up from her stroller at the legs of fellow civil rights marchers. Her cutest baby anecdote is freighted with time and history: \u201cMy mother would laugh telling a story she loved about the time when I was fussing as a toddler. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 she asked, trying to soothe me. \u2018Fweedom!\u2019 I yelled back.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the only good moment in her primary campaign of 2019, Harris identified herself explicitly and indignantly as a Black child of the 1960s. She attacked Biden for his opposition to the policy of integrating school systems by busing pupils from Black families to white-dominated areas: \u201cYou know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Her campaign tweeted a picture of Harris as a little girl, her hair in pigtails tied with bows. It then produced T-shirts printed with this image and the words \u201c THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME .\u201d Childhood yarns are part of the grammar of American politics, but this one is different. It is more defiant than endearing, more confrontational than sentimental.\n\nThe image of a Black girl in pigtails has its own specific history. In 1954, just months after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found educational segregation to be unconstitutional, Scientific American published an article titled \u201cThe Biology of the Negro.\u201d It was written by Curt Stern, an influential geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley\u2014the same university to which Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had traveled from India to study nutrition and endocrinology. It followed a lecture Stern had delivered in 1946 under the title \u201cWhy Do People Differ?\u201d According to the historian of medicine Michael Yudell:\n\nThe program for the lecture pictured a cartoon with three girls, two of whom were white, one black. The local chapter of the NAACP objected to the picture of a shabbily dressed black girl in pigtails wearing boots flanked by two well-dressed white girls looking at the black girl and smiling.\n\nBut in 1964, just months before Harris was born, Look magazine published what became a famous painting by Norman Rockwell called The Problem We All Live With. It shows another little Black girl in pigtails, this time neatly dressed in all-white clothes that emphasize the color of her skin. She is six-year-old Ruby Bridges, walking determinedly to her first day at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans in 1960. Towering over her, so high that their faces are out of the frame, are four men identified by their yellow armbands as deputy US marshals. Behind Bridges is a wall splattered with the bloodred juice of a hurled tomato and graffitied in bold letters with the N-word. By inviting his viewers to see this painting as a reality \u201cwe all\u201d live with, Rockwell was saying this violence is every bit as American as his supposedly nostalgic images of a vanishing small-town way of life.\n\nWhen Harris produced her THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME T-shirts, she was invoking her own history as well as the image of Ruby Bridges. And what\u2019s striking about this is that \u201ca Norman Rockwell view of America\u201d is proverbial shorthand for a sanitized and sentimentalized version of the past. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear (2018), Trump\u2019s economic adviser Gary Cohn made this very accusation against the then president in a heated argument over the nature of contemporary America: \u201c\u2018Mr. President,\u2019 Cohn said, trying to summarize, \u2018You have a Norman Rockwell view of America.\u2019\u201d Harris, to the contrary, evokes a very different \u201cNorman Rockwell view of America,\u201d one in which racial violence and resistance are acknowledged as part of a shared reality.\n\nThe creation of \u201cthat little girl\u201d involved the making of a profound choice about American history\u2014and about its most toxic aspect: slavery. Of all the \u201cfirsts\u201d that Harris represents\u2014first female vice-president, first Black woman and first Indian American to contest the presidency\u2014the one that goes unspoken is that if she wins in November, she will be the first openly acknowledged descendant of slaves to lead America. In this identification there is a complex interplay between freedom and necessity. It can perhaps best be appreciated through the uncanny recurrence of the same Irish name in her genealogy and in Biden\u2019s: Finnegan or Finegan. It is Biden\u2019s mother\u2019s surname and a constant point of reference in his idea of who he really is. It lives on in the name of his granddaughter Finnegan. It is also the name of Harris\u2019s father\u2019s maternal grandmother, Miss Iris, a Black woman born, as he recalled in a 2020 essay, \u201cIris Finegan.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s parents split up when she was five, and her father subsequently had a limited place in her life. Donald Harris, a leftist critic of orthodox theories of underdevelopment, became the first Black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford\u2019s economics department. He wrote of Kamala and her sister, Maya, that \u201cmy one big regret is that they did not come to know very well the two most influential women in my life,\u201d Miss Iris and his other grandmother, Miss Chrishy. Donald reproduced with his essay a photograph of Miss Iris with a two-year-old Kamala on her knee. He recalled how\n\nwe drove up to Thatch Walk and worked our way, with lots of cuts and bruises, through the same cane fields where Miss Iris had run a thriving business in the \u201cgood ole days\u201d of sugar and, a long time before, had probably been part of a slave plantation.\n\nThis locates a potential American president in the fields where some of her ancestors were enslaved to the brutal task of cutting cane.\n\nIn this other history, a name like Finegan loses the meaning it has for Biden: a sense of continuity, an uncomplicated connection to a genetic heritage. These Irish ancestors cannot be assumed to be what they are to Biden\u2014heroic underdogs. Miss Chrishy was born Christiana Brown, and Donald Harris believes her to be a \u201cdescendant of Hamilton Brown.\u201d Hamilton Brown, who owned a large number of slaves in Jamaica and fiercely opposed abolition, was also Irish, born in County Antrim. But unlike John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Biden, and even Barack Obama, all of whom engaged in the public ritual of visiting Ireland to celebrate their ancestral roots, Harris would probably not want to celebrate her distant Finegan and Brown cousins.\n\nThis is because Blackness is seldom a free choice. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists at the end of July, Trump claimed that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d and had previously been identifying only with her Indian heritage. \u201cIs she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one but she obviously doesn\u2019t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she became a Black person.\u201d This was a lie\u2014Harris has always identified as Black. But it also revealed a certain kind of truth about one of the ways racism operates: Trump\u2019s attack on Harris was based on the assumption that she must be either Black or not Black.\n\nIt is easy for white Americans to pick an ethnicity\u2014Biden could have decided to identify with his French or English, rather than his Irish, heritage. It is easy for white Americans to tell little lies about their ancestry. Trump himself has more than once falsely claimed that his father, Fred, who was born in New York, was in fact born in Germany: \u201cMy father is German, was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany, so I have a very great feeling for Germany.\u201d Fred Trump himself claimed for some years that he was Swedish. Harris, on the other hand, could not cherry-pick from among her complex origins. Her mother was indeed born in India and lived there until she was nineteen. Yet Gopalan understood that her girls were not going to be perceived in America as Brahmins. As Harris puts it in The Truths We Hold:\n\nMy mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.\n\nThis is not a relishing of the openness of identity in America. It is something much more serious: an attempt to find the freedom within inevitability. Gopalan understood that her daughters could not escape the identity that a racist society would impose on them, including the history of enslavement that is part of their ancestry. What they could do is find the pride within that identity and embody the resistance that is the other side of that history.\n\nThey had to do this in an atmosphere of ferocious political engagement, in which these same questions of freedom and necessity were being hammered out within Black radicalism. Trump seeks to define Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d and there is no doubt that Republicans will delve into her parents\u2019 political stances in the 1960s to find evidence for this characterization. But it is the exact opposite of the truth. The radical left is a huge influence on Harris\u2014in the sense that she is part of a generational reaction against the revolutionary Black politics of the 1960s. She is a child of the revolution only in the sense that she grew up in its wreckage.\n\nThere is a figure in The Truths We Hold who is both named and not named, both intimately embraced and held at a distance. He is introduced as follows: Harris writes that San Francisco State University \u201chad a student-run Experimental College, and in 1966, another of my mother\u2019s dear friends, whom I knew as Uncle Aubrey, taught the college\u2019s first-ever class in black studies.\u201d We later learn that Aubrey\u2019s aunt, Regina Shelton, was a \u201csecond mother\u201d to Kamala and that \u201cwe shared a long-standing relationship of love, care, and connection\u201d to this extended family. Uncle Aubrey is not given his full name, Aubrey LaBrie. Nor does Harris say much about his politics.\n\nIn 2019 Harris told Molly Ball of Time that she remembered coming \u201cdown the stairs of her childhood house in Berkeley to see FREE BOBBY carved in wet cement, after the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was arrested.\u201d Her childhood world was that from which the Panthers emerged. In 1965 LaBrie, along with his brothers Huey and Abdul and other friends, founded a periodical called Black Dialogue. It was in part a cultural magazine, publishing stories, poems, and essays alongside graphic art by young Black painters. But it was also highly political, and Aubrey is listed as its \u201cpolitical editor,\u201d presumably responsible for its ideological direction. Its first issue appeared in the aftermath of the murder of Malcolm X and is \u201cproudly dedicated\u201d to his memory as a \u201cgreat leader and a greater MAN .\u201d\n\nIt was also produced immediately after the brutal police assault on peaceful civil rights marchers at Selma. It seethes with both the passion and the anguish of uncertainty that so many young Black activists felt in the face of such loss and violence. It despairs of the possibilities of looking to the two spheres that Kamala Harris would go on to inhabit\u2014the law and democratic politics\u2014to win justice:\n\nThe Black Americans are nauseated by the practices of the White community that are, to them, mockingly meaningless, hypocritical, dishonest and essentially amoral. These young Black people have no faith in the Constitution and no respect for the White man\u2019s law. Why should they? What has it done for them? The law is dispensed in a manner which makes it a great big atrocious lie. It is merely another weapon to use against them.\n\nAfter the Watts riots in Los Angeles in August 1965, when South Central LA became a combat zone and thirty-four people died, Black Dialogue published a call to arms by Aubrey LaBrie\u2019s younger brother Huey:\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters of Watts, how proud we are of you. You who burned the city of angels and shook the crumbling white power structure\u2026. The enemy called it a riot but we know that it was an insurrection. It was one battle in the \u201cwar of Armageddon\u201d or the war between the black and white. The blacks who participated in the insurrection introduced an extremely effective tactic of igniting fires to local parasitical white business communities. They were not rioters or hoodlums, they were guerrillas.\n\nThere is an irony here. The \u201cwar of Armageddon,\u201d as invoked in Black Dialogue, was almost certainly drawn from the preaching of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. But it now has no purchase on the American left or on mainstream Black politics. Where it does have a strong grip is on the dark imagination of Trumpism. The insurrectionist violence that Trump unleashed with the invasion of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was fed by the millenarian vision of a coming civil war, framed by many of its believers as a racial \u201cwar between the black and white.\u201d The Republican Party has moved into the orbit of apocalyptic tribalism. If you want to see a figure who represents the most definitive movement out of that orbit, look at Harris.\n\nHarris told Ball in 2019 that \u201cthe reality is that when you are the so-called minority you learn many languages, necessarily.\u201d She did not mean literal languages but rather the languages of power. Harris entered the very arenas her mother\u2019s friends and political allies had despaired of: the law, party politics, elective public office. She chose to believe what the previous generation could not\u2014that justice can be achieved by working from inside the existing institutional structures. It is an act of faith that critics of her work as a prosecutor and attorney general in California do not believe to be justified in practice by the way she used her power. She sought to uphold some wrongful convictions, threatened to prosecute parents of habitually truant children (a policy that disproportionately affected people of color), and even appealed a federal court ruling that California\u2019s death penalty is unconstitutional (in spite of her own complete repudiation of the death penalty). But her caution is not mere moderation or bland centrism. It comes from a complex personal and political navigation between the desire for freedom on the one side and the tight constraints of reality on the other.\n\nThat weighing of what is right against what is possible is the business of democracy, and Harris represents the way the left has accepted that difficult responsibility. American politics has ended up in a place where it is those on the right who want to burn everything down. They will do that, if they can, in the name of a phony American normality that excludes Harris and everyone who shares with her a complex identity. It is striking, therefore, that Harris\u2019s candidacy has given Democrats permission to point out how \u201cweird\u201d the Republicans\u2019 version of America really is. Walz put the word into circulation just days after Biden announced his departure from the national stage. In a punchy statement after Trump appeared on Fox News, the Harris campaign listed as one of the main takeaways: \u201cTrump is old and quite weird?\u201d The conjunction of these two qualities implies that what is truly strange is not just Trump\u2019s chronological age but the anachronistic vision in which only white men who plant their seed in fertile women are authentic citizens and legitimate rulers. Against that weirdness, we have the real possibility of a president whose history is synchronized with American reality.\n\n\u2014August 20, 2024"

            "text": "When Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate for this November\u2019s presidential election, most Americans had no idea who the Minnesota governor actually was. But as people outside of Minnesota get to know Walz, it\u2019s becoming clear through a torrent of stories shared online that he\u2019s one of the most likable politicians around. Why? He just seems like a very normal and kind person. And it\u2019s hard to find a sharper contrast between Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate JD Vance than \u201cnormal and kind.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump and Vance are clearly frustrated with being called \u201cweird,\u201d a verbal jab against modern Republicans that was first popularized by Walz. But Trump and Vance are clearly stumped about how to hit back. Because every new day online seems to deliver an anecdote or story from Walz that makes him seem both relatable and caring. And after years of Trumpism dominating the headlines with an ideology built on cruelty and humiliation, a guy like Walz is extremely refreshing.\n\nTake an old story about Walz that started going viral on Wednesday. Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, was interviewed by Politico about the fact that she would become the first Native American woman to be governor of any state. At the end of the interview, Flanagan told a story about how Walz helped her when her child got lice.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nI heard you say that your daughter was discovered to have lice the day after the 2018 election. Can you share how the newly elected Walz-Flanagan ticket handled that early crisis? My first instinct was to call Congressman Tim Walz, also governor-elect Tim Walz, to say, \u201cHelp, my child has lice, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d So that was interesting. But he was amazing. I was super freaked out. We\u2019d never dealt with it before. Siobhan was a total trooper. He said, \u201cGo to Target, and then FaceTime me from the aisle.\u201d And so I did. He had me show all the different shampoos and stuff. He was like, \u201cThis is the one that you get.\u201d And then he\u2019s like, \u201cOnce you get home, FaceTime me again.\u201d So I FaceTimed him again from the bathroom, as I\u2019m picking nits out of my child\u2019s hair. And he was amazing and coached me through the whole thing, and that is who Tim Walz is.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of story that we\u2019re hearing more and more about Walz over the years. As a teacher and coach, he touched the lives of so many people as a helpful father figure, as so many of his former students tell it. And the army of pro-Trump trolls who are trying to take him down just don\u2019t understand his appeal.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s been going viral this week involving Walz is his interview with Subway Takes on TikTok. Walz discusses how important he thinks good gutter maintenance is. And it\u2019s just the latest example of Walz talking about normal things that normal people discuss in their everyday lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to post the most vile things imaginable on social media. For example, Trump retweeted an image on Truth Social that showed Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris with the caption, \u201cFunny how blowjobs impacted both of their careers differently.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d as it were is that Clinton\u2019s husband was involved with a White House intern in the 1990s and Harris was dating Willie Brown. The right has repeatedly tried to claim, without any evidence, that she only succeeded professionally because she was dating Brown. It\u2019s a common attack from retrograde assholes. But normal people don\u2019t find it amusing. At least they don\u2019t anymore.\n\nThe late-night comedians of the 1990s tore Monica Lewinsky to shreds with those kinds of jokes. But here in the 2020s, the U.S. public sees Lewinsky much differently than she was depicted in late 20th-century news and comedy programs. And that\u2019s probably why these assholes don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re the weird ones. Guys like Trump and Vance are trying to bring America back to the 1990s, back when Trump thought he was hot shit and Vance was a kid. Both men are trying to turn back the clock, from their stupid jokes to their ideas about reproductive health. But there\u2019s a reason that Harris has embraced a slogan that really seems to resonate with most people: We\u2019re not going back."

She addressed plans to make housing more affordable and to expand the child tax credit, and she acknowledged that despite economic growth since the pandemic, prices are still too high for many Americans.\n\n\u201cPrices, in particular for groceries, are still too high. The American people know it. I know it,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris, who was joined by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sat down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for the interview during a campaign swing in Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe wide-ranging conversation was a high-stakes moment for Harris, after she had faced mounting pressure to do an interview with a major news outlet to share her own policies and take questions on her prior positions, some of which have changed since she became President Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020.\n\nBash pressed Harris on her shifted stances on both banning fracking and decriminalizing border crossings. Harris in 2019, when she first ran for president, said she was against a fracking ban and was for decriminalizing border crossings. Her stance on both policies has changed since then \u2014 but Harris insisted that her values have not.\n\n\u201cI think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is, my values have not changed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\u201d\n\nHarris said she would keep her word that she would not ban fracking \u2014 an issue that is front and center in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd on decriminalizing border crossings, Harris said, \u201cI believe there should be consequences. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHarris also addressed foreign policy, namely the continued U.S. aid to Israel in its war in Gaza. When asked if Harris would withhold some shipments of weapons to Israel, Harris did not directly answer the question, and instead reiterated her call for a ceasefire deal and getting the hostages home.\n\n\u201cI remain committed since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self determination and dignity,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the interview, Harris also committed to having a Republican in her presidential cabinet \u2013 and said it would be to the benefit of the American public to have someone who has different views and different experiences working with her.\n\nThe interview was wide-ranging, covering Walz\u2019s record and past controversies, President Biden\u2019s legacy and ability to serve, as well as the phone call between Biden and Harris the day he decided to step down from the race.\n\nQuestions over Walz\u2019 comments on weapons of war, and his path to having children\n\nWalz had only a few questions directed at him during the interview. He was asked about previous comments he made in 2018 about carrying a weapon into war \u2013 which Walz never did. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war and my wife, the English teacher, telling me my grammar is not always correct,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cMy record speaks for itself\u2026 I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWalz and his wife used a method known as IUI to have children \u2013 but has said they used IVF in the past. On that issue, Walz said he thinks most Americans \u201cget it if you\u2019ve been through that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child,\u201d he said.\n\nNew details on the call between Biden and Harris when Biden stepped down\n\nHarris revealed that she was spending time with her family, cooking breakfast and about to sit down for a puzzle when Biden called her last month to let her know he was ending his campaign for reelection.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 \u201d Harris said.\n\nShe noted that Biden made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that he was going to support Harris\u2019 campaign for president. She called the president \u201cselfless\u201d and said he puts the American people first.\n\nRepublicans like Trump had been accusing Harris of trying to dodge tough questions\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a month since Biden dropped out of the race, and in the absence of a 1-on-1 Harris interview or press conference, Republicans have accused the vice president of trying to dodge the press to avoid tough questions. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done an interview,\u201d former President Donald Trump said during a news conference earlier this month at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent, and she can\u2019t do an interview.\u201d\n\nPrior to becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris had taken plenty of questions from reporters as the sitting vice president. Her team says she\u2019s done 80 interviews this year \u2014 in traditional, network media as well as on podcasts and social media.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut in these previous conversations she was generally selling Biden\u2019s agenda. Like most vice presidents, she was a messenger and a deputy. Now, she\u2019s running for the top job, and this CNN interview may be one of the first times she\u2019s pressed to spell out her own policies and answer questions about how, if at all, she would govern differently than Biden.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d have to answer more of these questions,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible to run for president and not answer them.\u201d\n\nHarris will, undoubtedly, face additional scrutiny about her record and positions when she faces off against Trump in the debate expected next month.\n\nTrump, for his part, posted on his platform Truth Social as the interview with Harris aired on CNN.\n\n\u201cI look so forward to Debating Comrade Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is. Harris has changed every one of her long held positions, on everything,\u201d he said. He also posted: \u201cBORING!!!\u201d\n\n"

Read preview\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, one issue at the forefront of voters' minds is how to afford a house as homeownership becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Harris-Walz campaign unveiled a slew of housing policies to combat this issue, including a proposal to provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, with more generous aid for first-generation homeowners.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAt first glance, down payment assistance might seem like a great idea, but according to Zillow Chief Economist Skylar Olsen, it's not an effective solution to the housing crisis.\n\nPolicies like these effectively act as subsidies that cause widespread spikes in housing demand as people rush to buy, according to Olsen. However, if nothing is done to address the dearth of housing supply, then jump-starting nationwide demand will simply exacerbate the housing crisis as people scramble to snatch up already-scarce homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The demand side doesn't help over the long run,\" Olsen said. \"If you want sweeping policy that's very generalizable, have it be on the supply side.\"\n\nOlsen also doesn't think the first-time homebuyer criteria is the most useful way to increase housing access for those who need it the most.\n\n\"I could be a first-time buyer, but I have a great network, a bank of mom and dad, that could help me move forward. And now you've given me an extra boost,\" Olsen said.\n\nFocusing on boosting first-generation homeownership could help combat that issue, which Harris' plan addresses, although the exact details have yet to be revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Olsen believes a federal down payment assistance plan is simply a band-aid fix for structural issues in the US housing market \u2014 namely, lack of supply.\n\n\"It can end up just getting us revved up without solving the long-run problem,\" Olsen said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHere's what will actually help home affordability\n\nThat's not to say that all down payment assistance plans are doomed to fail. When done right, these programs can be quite beneficial, Olsen said.\n\nThe key comes down to whether such a plan is implemented at the federal or local level. According to Olsen, local homebuying incentives that increase demand are more targeted than a blanket federal policy like the one Harris proposed, making them more effective in increasing homeowning accessibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, a state with a low population might have a lot of underused infrastructure. In this case, incentives to boost housing demand at the state level could help redistribute people to areas with excess home supply.\n\n\"If you want to solve things with the demand side of the coin for the long run, it's gonna be more about 'How do I get the people to want to go where the supply is?'\" Olsen said.\n\nBut again, Olsen believes that policies increasing the housing supply are the most effective way to alleviate the current housing crisis.\n\nHarris has actually put out proposals addressing the supply side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion aims to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. The fund will provide $20 billion in funding to lower land use restrictions, modernize zoning policies, stimulate development, and encourage innovative housing solutions. This plan emphasizes building multifamily rental units and starter homes for middle-class families, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of units.\n\nAnd the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit provides tax credits to developers who build affordable housing units, which helps low-income tenants in finding affordable and available units. This policy encourages mixed-income developments such as multifamily housing rented to tenants from a variety of income backgrounds."

Now they finally have a presidential ticket that explicitly echoes their agenda.\n\nThese activists and their diverse coalition \u2014 who call themselves YIMBYs, for \"yes in my backyard\" \u2014 have sprung into action to support Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. On Wednesday night, they held a two-hour virtual \"YIMBYs for Harris\" fundraiser featuring dozens of local, state, and federal lawmakers who believe in building lots more housing.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nPro-housing advocates say Harris' proposal to build 3 million homes in her first term, in part through cutting government regulations restricting construction, feels like a big shift toward addressing the country's housing shortage. It doesn't hurt that Harris selected as her running mate a governor who has championed pro-housing policies in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris and other top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, highlighted the housing shortage in their speeches at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 sending YIMBYs into a tizzy. Democrats in Washington have long supported demand-side housing policies, including subsidies for homebuyers and low-income renters. But recent national messaging on the issue has focused much more squarely on solving the supply shortage, which is particularly severe in blue states and cities where onerous permitting requirements, environmental reviews, and opposition from so-called NIMBYs \u2014 \"not in my backyard\" \u2014 have hamstrung efforts to build more homes.\n\n\"There's always been Democrats saying we should fund more affordable housing,\" Armand Domalewski, a San Francisco-based data analyst who helped organize YIMBYs for Harris, told Business Insider. What's new on the national stage, he added, is \"the perspective that part of the issue is local and state governments obstructing housing.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nShortly after Domalewski set up a WhatsApp group for pro-housing voters about three weeks ago, \"it just exploded,\" he said. About 300 people are in the chat, he said, and the group estimated that about 6,000 people attended Wednesday's virtual fundraiser, which raised more than $100,000.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, a headliner at the fundraiser, argued that his party was experiencing a \"generational shift\" in its approach to housing. He's called Harris \"the first presidential nominee in at least a generation that cares about housing.\" Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado similarly described Harris at the event as \"the most pro-housing president in the history of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want somebody that is actually going to work to solve the problem of the housing shortage,\" Schatz said. \"And the simplest way to solve the problem of the housing shortage is to make it permissible for people to build as much housing as they can, especially for working people.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, a 46-year-old California Democrat who's been one of the loudest urbanist voices in Congress, noted in his remarks during the fundraiser that he was organizing the first YIMBY congressional caucus.\n\nThe fact that housing policy is high on the list of national Democratic priorities indicates how severe the affordability crisis has gotten. Harris, Obama, and other top Democrats aren't suddenly YIMBY converts \u2014 they're talking about the housing shortage because Americans are more worried about it. In a recent survey , 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans said they thought a lack of affordable housing was a significant problem.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't said much on the campaign trail about housing, though he and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have argued they could solve the supply shortage by deporting millions of immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral speakers at the YIMBY fundraiser argued that, despite being the anti-regulation party, Republicans had embraced red tape that limits what can be built and where. In the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 agenda, Ben Carson, who was Trump's secretary of housing and urban development, wrote that Republicans should \"oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning.\""

This has made the app a favorite tool for far-right extremist groups, terrorist organizations and criminal gangs. Investigators say Durov failed to cooperate with them, which would have helped them shut down the illegal operations. He is now under judicial supervision and banned from leaving French territory.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump shared a TikTok video yesterday including footage that likely violates federal law against using military cemeteries for campaigning purposes.

Maintaining voter rolls is a critical election safeguard and federal law says it can\u2019t happen within 90 days of an election.

There are people who are famous because they are important \u2014 think presidents.

            "headline": "What's Your 'Sleep Language'? Here Are the 5 Different Types and How to Speak Yours",
            "text": "There's a reason why experts suggest adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. From preventing forgetfulness to impacting your life expectancy, there's a laundry list of health reasons you should be getting quality sleep each night. However, reaching that goal isn't always easy. It can be difficult to find the correct code of hacks to unlock your sleep potential and get the rest your body needs.\n\nShelby Harris, a clinical sleep psychologist, is aiming to crack that code through partnership with the popular meditation app and mental health brand Calm. Harris and Calm have published a working understanding of the \"five sleep languages\" -- a sectioning off of a few different sleeping patterns (or lack thereof) to give people more actionable steps to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNET\n\nHarris said she came up with the five different sleep languages after considering differences among her patients over her 20 years of experience and noticing that there are a handful of categories they tend to fall into.\n\n\"We can give people a whole list of sleep hygiene targets to follow or when they should see a sleep doctor, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming for people,\" Harris said. The goal of the different sleep languages is to meet people where they are in their sleep health journey.\n\n\"It helps to guide where they want to go with what they can start with.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about your sleep language and how to use this knowledge to improve your sleep. For more advice on how to improve your sleep quality, here are eight ways to promote sleepiness and how your diet is linked to your sleep.\n\nThe 5 sleep languages and tips for speaking yours\n\nHarris has landed on five sleep languages, but it's important to note you can switch between them throughout your lifetime, she says.\n\nBelow are the five sleep languages, as described in Calm's blog.\n\n1. The 'gifted' sleeper\n\nIf you're a gifted sleeper, you probably appear to the people around you just as that -- gifted, in the name of sleep. Maybe you can fall asleep anywhere, no matter the noise or background light, or you have no problem napping. Any way you slice it, the gifted sleeper typically doesn't have a problem falling or staying asleep.\n\nTips for the gifted sleeper\n\nWhile this may seem like the \"best\" sleep language category to belong to, objectively speaking, gifted sleepers might want to see a sleep doctor if they're sleeping too much, as it could be a sign of a health condition. It can be especially important to follow up with a doctor if you're sleeping a lot but still not feeling well rested.\n\nBut if there isn't something else at play, consider whether you're actually playing catchup on sleep deprivation and whether you can benefit from a stricter sleep routine, according to the Calm post.\n\n2. The 'words of worry' sleeper\n\nIf you're a \"words of worry\" sleeper, you might know who you are. Your brain is loud at night, clouded with the \"what ifs\" of the day, and what you have to get done tomorrow. Whether it be the past or the present, a words of worry sleeper is focused on another time other than the present and the physical focus at hand: sleep.\n\nTips those who worry about sleep\n\n\"I have a lot of patients that come to me where their brains just won't turn off,\" Harris said. If you can relate to this, be clear on your sleep boundaries and limit things like screen time, or cross-contaminating nonsleep activities in the bedroom, like work. You may also benefit from adding a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation to your day, or trying this CNET to-do list hack for better sleep.\n\nWorking or scrolling in bed is a no-go when you're looking to improve your sleep. Skaman306/Getty Images\n\n3. The 'routine perfectionist' sleeper\n\nIf you're a perfectionist sleeper, you may have followed our sleep advice a little too hard to the detriment of your happiness, and sometimes, your sleep. You may be a perfectionist sleeper if you find yourself missing out on fun events, or other special occasions that may be important to you, over fear of having one night of poor sleep. Or when something or someone throws your sleep off, you're irritated.\n\n\"Those people I often see because they used to be a words of worry person or have some type of sleep issue, that then they became hyperobsessed with it,\" Harris said.\n\nTips for those a little too perfect about sleep\n\nAs laid out in the Calm blog, perfectionist sleepers will benefit from a little more flexibility and switching things up -- things that will create \"less attachment\" to your sleep routine. To get started, move around the order of your sleep routine slightly (maybe you'll brush your teeth before you put on your pajamas today, for example).\n\nLike the other sleep languages, a perfect sleeper may benefit from practicing mindfulness, which can improve your ability to relate to anxiety-inducing thoughts in a way that's not so stressful.\n\n4. The 'too hot to handle' sleeper\n\nIt's in the name, but if you're too hot to handle, you're too hot to sleep. Menopause, perimenopause, other health conditions or even a mismatched bed partner with a different internal temperature can make you too hot to handle.\n\nTips for sleep hotties\n\nIf you're waking up drenched in sweat, or you're finding yourself frequently uncomfortable at night, check in with your doctor to see what underlying health condition may be at play. Medication side effects or hormonal changes can also influence how warm you feel at night, as the Calm post points out.\n\nBut if your bed partner is the culprit, follow this CNET tip and consider getting two separate blankets or comforters, which can also cut down on blanket tug-of-war.\n\n5. The 'light as a feather' sleeper\n\nLight sleepers wake up easily from noise, light or even a strong smell. If you're light as a feather, you might wake up in the morning after a solid seven or eight hours on the pillow still feeling unrested or sleepy.\n\nTips for those light as a feather\n\nIf you're restless and not getting the quality of sleep you want, consider sharpening your bedtime routine and adding a bit more structure -- including setting those bed boundaries, like not scrolling through social media or eating in your bed. (Loose crumbs itching your bare legs may be the last thing a light sleeper needs.)\n\nCalm and Harris also suggest reaching out to a sleep professional if you're concerned about the quality of your rest, screening for sleep conditions such as sleep talking, grinding teeth and sleep apnea.\n\nD3sign/Getty Images\n\nThe link between mental health and sleep\n\nHarris says she decided to partner with Calm in response to the current mental health crisis. The pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of anxiety, eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Mental health can be improved or harmed by someone's sleep patterns.\n\nSleep deprivation, in particular, can affect your ability to stay in control of your emotions or come up with solutions to seemingly not-so-complicated problems that can feel like the end of the world when you're sleep-deprived. (I asked Harris if there was any truth to my feeling like I regress to a child's ability to handle emotions when I'm sleep-deprived, and she explained that sleep deprivation disrupts the part of our mind responsible for reasoning and judgment, and our ability to toggle between states, or our cognitive flexibility.)\n\n\"With sleep deprivation in general, we find higher rates of anxiety, higher rates of depression, higher rates of stress,\" she said. \"And we find their stress tolerance and ability to cope with daily stressors becomes much more difficult.\"\n\nThe critical component is REM sleep, which you may be deficient in if you're regularly lacking sleep. This could lead to problems in your relationship or at work.\n\n\"REM sleep is really important for emotion processing, memories,\" Harris said. \"If you're waking up early or you're not getting enough REM sleep routinely, you're gonna have trouble with irritability, depression, anxiety, all that jazz.\"\n\nAnother bottom line on good sleep\n\nDespite the number of times we preach the health benefits of sleep, there's a thread in society that may be pushing back against the idea that healthy sleep trumps all. But according to Harris, \"No pun intended, you're living in a dream world a little bit,\" if you're trying to check off everything else on the wellness list before you start prioritizing sleep. Centering sleep will help you stabilize and prioritize all the other tasks you have during the day.\n\n\"We have to stop the hamster wheel somewhere, and if you stop it by prioritizing sleep, it makes the daytime run smoother.\""

            "headline": "How Beau Biden Set the Stage For Kamala Harris\u2019 Stunning Political Rise",
            "text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere were days the pair talked to each other more than they spoke to the people who slept under their roofs.\n\nKamala Harris was the state attorney general of California and Beau Biden was in the same role over in Delaware, where so many of the banks she was fighting were based. At the height of the clean-up from the 2008 financial crisis, more than a million California households caught up in the foreclosure wave were struggling to stay in their homes. For Harris to help any of them, she needed backup from Biden, who had oversight over Wilmington, Del., the banking industry's stealth capital. That partnership helped Harris emerge as one of the only political leaders in the country seen as holding bankers accountable for predatory practices.\n\nBeau Biden had Harris\u2019 flank until the end of his too-brief life, which ended in 2015 at age 46. Five years later, the man Beau called \u201cPop\u201d tapped Harris as his running mate, creating one of the most unlikely partnerships in Democratic politics. And when President Joe Biden decided to forgo the nomination this year and clear the way for Harris, it was the dividend on an accidental alliance forged in the early 2010s when two rising stars of the Democratic Party aligned and, to the point it\u2019s become canon, actually became sincere friends.\n\nBeau Biden was atop Harris\u2019 mind last month when she accepted the elder Biden\u2019s endorsement to be the next President. \u201cI first came to know President Biden through his son, Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe\u2019s leadership as President.\u201d\n\nTrite? Sure. But it has the benefit of also happening to be true.\n\nUp until Beau Biden\u2019s death, Joe Biden long believed his son had the potential to surpass his own impressive political career. So when the elder Biden tapped Harris four years ago this month, it was in no small measure based on her true friendship with the younger Biden. As I wrote at the time, one question hung over his deliberation more than any other: What Would Beau Do? That\u2019s how Biden got to yes on Harris, despite his primary rivalry with her and a skepticism that she actually believed in the vision for America she was pitching in her own White House run.\n\n\u201cI first met Kamala through my son Beau,\u201d Biden said during his roll-out of Harris. \u201cHe had enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one\u2019s opinion I valued more than Beau\u2019s, and I\u2019m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Joe Biden stood aside to give Harris her best shot to date at winning the top job in global politics. In ways great and small, it was a moment set up by Beau Biden, who in the aughts connected with his colleague in California and decided they\u2019d be great partners\u2014and, perhaps, the future of their shared Democratic Party. One succumbed to brain cancer and the other is currently leading Donald Trump in most national polls. What started as a check on banking overreach now stands to be the driving force behind Democratic politics. And, from the outside, it looks like a not entirely bad level of match-making.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter."

            "text": "After major police endorsement, Rep. Gallego faces backlash from progressive groups\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nAfter drawing praise for an endorsement by Arizona police, Rep. Ruben Gallego has now drawn anger and disappointment from some Arizona progressives for discouraging the Department of Justice from imposing federal oversight on the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department \u2014 sent one day after the Arizona Police Association announced it\u2019s backing Gallego in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race \u2014 the congressman said federal investigators \u201cmissed the mark\u201d in their examination of Phoenix police.\n\nThat nearly three-year investigation concluded in June that Phoenix police have engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of using excessive force, acting with bias and violating constitutional and civil rights.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn his letter, Gallego described those violations \u2013 \u201ca mere 120 or so unspecified incidents across eight years,\u201d he wrote \u2013 as isolated, not pervasive. And he argued against the need for federal oversight for the city\u2019s police department, a position aligned with some of the Phoenix City Council members, who\u2019ve resisted calls from community groups for the DOJ\u2019s further involvement.\n\nPhoenix police and city officials \u201calready welcome reforms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOversight, Gallego wrote, would be best left to local government.\n\n\n\nPolice back \u2018a freaking loser\u2019\n\nWhen it was announced Monday, the Arizona Police Association\u2019s endorsement was a coup for Gallego\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe APA describes itself as an umbrella organization \u2013 \u201can association of associations\u201d \u2013 that brings together various law enforcement entities from across the state. In doing so, they represent thousands of law enforcement officers in Arizona.\n\nThe week prior, APA President Justin Harris had joined Donald Trump onstage at a rally in Glendale to announce the organization\u2019s support of the former president \u2013 someone who Harris said could get our country \u201cback on track and make America great again.\u201d\n\nAlso onstage that day, Trump described Gallego as \u201ca freaking loser.\u201d\n\nDays later, the APA endorsed that \u201closer\u201d \u2013 \u201ca Marine combat veteran\u201d who \u201cunderstands the complexities of modern policing in American society today,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe APA does not take our endorsements lightly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe recognize the importance of having a U.S. senator that can bring people together to improve society for all. We believe Congressman Gallego will be that U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an endorsement that should come in handy as Gallego defends his record from the Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee, Kari Lake, who the APA endorsed for governor in 2022.\n\nWhile a Lake spokesperson accused Gallego of supporting the defunding of police, Harris praised the congressman for backing federal legislation to boost hiring and retention of police officers.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gallego has continually fought for robust, increased funding for America\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Just lost my vote\u2019\n\nGallego\u2019s letter stunned Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona.\n\n\u201cTo act as if (the DOJ\u2019s report) is in some way not accurately reflective of \u2013 detailing the significant problems with the Phoenix Police Department, is simply not true,\u201d Keenan said.\n\nThe timing of the letter, immediately following the endorsement of the state\u2019s largest independent law enforcement organization, made it worse, he said.\n\n\u201cIt seems very transactional,\u201d Keenan said.\n\n\u201cA lot of city officials and Rep. Gallego, they speak about public safety,\u201d he added. \u201cBut true public safety cannot ignore constitutional rights. It cannot ignore the violence perpetrated by the Phoenix Police Department on members of our community. And to issue statements like this is, frankly, dangerous, because it will embolden the police not to reform themselves.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Poder In Action, a community group that routinely lodges complaints about police treatment of Black, brown and Indigenous communities, called the claims in the letter \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to the communities Gallego represents in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is really just ridiculous to, after all of this evidence, to say that this department can change itself,\u201d executive director Viri Hernandez said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHernandez also said she wasn\u2019t shocked Gallego\u2019s letter came on the heels of the APA endorsement.\n\n\u201cOur community sees the way that police unions, when they support candidates, most of the time \u2014 every example we\u2019ve seen \u2014 also leads to those candidates pushing back against accountability, transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether the police endorsement was tied to the DOJ letter, a spokesperson for the Gallego campaign says there was \u201cno agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuben Gallego has a record of fighting for Arizona\u2019s law enforcement in Congress and is proud to have the support of the Arizona Police Association,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nPoder In Action isn\u2019t in the business of endorsing candidates. As a 501(c)3, they\u2019re barred from intervening in political campaigns. \u201cOur focus is to expose the discrepancies, the lies from any party \u2013 Democrats or Republicans,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell folks who to vote for, who to not vote for,\u201d she added.\n\nNeither does the ACLU of Arizona. But personally, Keenan didn\u2019t mince words when he first responded to the letter on X."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris\u2019s Gamble",
            "text": "In the first month of Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s improbable run for President, she allowed Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm about finally having a credible opponent to Donald Trump to define her candidacy. Once Joe Biden left the race and Harris let her intentions be known, the excitement vastly outweighed the need to know precisely what policies she was running on. Tens of thousands of people joined Zoom calls to raise funds and created networks aimed at supporting the Vice-President\u2019s run. Thousands more stood in line for hours to pack arenas for rallies, which became staging grounds for crafting the themes of her developing campaign.\n\nAt those rallies, the framing of her campaign came into focus. Harris adhered to typical liberal fare: raising the minimum wage and providing affordable housing and health care. She has been more pointed in her intentions to fight for abortion rights and to extend protections and rights to L.G.B.T.Q. people. By choosing as her running mate the genuinely populist governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, over the more moderate Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, Harris delighted progressives.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nBut the most excitement about Harris\u2019s surprise candidacy has been generated without her having to say a word. Her presence at the top of the ticket, as a biracial woman and the daughter of two immigrant parents, has served as a backlash to the backlash against 2020\u2019s national reckoning with the history of American racism. Even as Harris and Walz have deftly avoided any mention of race or racism in this contest, its centrality to the looming election is undeniable.\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party\u2019s long campaign to end affirmative action was finally realized by a U.S. Supreme Court packed with Trump appointees. Books about slavery and racism against African Americans and school curricula teaching Black history have been banned in some states and localities. In Florida, in an effort that has since been challenged in court but which captured the national mood, Republican legislators passed the so-called Stop WOKE Act, which tried to manage the teaching of Black history based on whether it was perceived to make white students feel guilty. Universities in states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Utah have closed centers and offices dedicated to diversity.\n\nSince Harris became the presumptive nominee, Trump has attacked her racial identity, intentionally mispronounced her name, and questioned her intelligence, going so far as to call her \u201cdumb.\u201d His running mate, J. D. Vance, has supported a national ban on abortion and described people without children as inferior to parents. Under these circumstances, supporting Harris can feel like an act of resistance.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention provided Harris with the opportunity to spell out the specifics of why she should be promoted to President. It was organized to project a new image of Harris as tough and, as her husband, Doug Emhoff, put it, \u201cready to lead.\u201d Democrats seized the opportunity to claim they were charting a new course for the country, emphasizing themes of joy and patriotism; the crowd periodically broke out into chants of \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d Love of country was laced throughout the speeches, in contrast to Trump\u2019s regular descriptions of the U.S. as a hellscape that only he can rescue. As Michelle Obama intoned, Harris \u201ctruly understands\u201d what has \u201calways made America great.\u201d The emotive goals of the Convention seemed to have been met, but what of the opportunity to map out the meaning of a Harris Presidency?\n\nFor all the talk about moving forward, the Democratic Party decided to feature the parts of its past that most troubled its core constituencies of Black and young voters. Bill Clinton made his mark on the Party by championing a turn away from social welfare and civil rights. His legacy includes policies that fuelled mass incarceration and demonized poor Black people, especially Black women, whom he made the focal point of his efforts to abolish welfare as an entitlement. During her campaign for the Presidency in 2016, Hillary Clinton was hounded by Black Lives Matter activists for referring to juveniles in 1996 as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Barack Obama may be adored by many, but it was under his Administration that Occupy Wall Street and the Black Lives Matter movement erupted, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises of his historic run for office.\n\nThat the Party featured the old guard while still claiming a new path reflected the tensions throughout the Convention: joy alongside Harris\u2019s bellicose promise of pursuing American values abroad with \u201cthe strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\u201d; challenges to misogyny and promotion of different kinds of family, but no concrete details on how Harris would address the crisis in child-care costs and the rising costs of living. The Convention featured four of the wrongly convicted, and since exonerated, Central Park Five before a segment that celebrated Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor. Most pointedly, speakers repeatedly framed the election as a struggle for democracy and a fight for freedom, yet the D.N.C. refused to give a single Palestinian American any time on the main stage. The refusal was in contrast to the Convention\u2019s parade of Republicans, who were given speaking slots because they rejected Trump.\n\nThese conflicting messages seemed intended to inspire and embolden the base while also reaching voters who have not yet made up their minds. This dual purpose left Harris ill-equipped to speak about how she and her party plan to address the central issues of the election, including the hardships driven by economic inequality and inflation. Instead, she offered vague platitudes, promising an \u201copportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed.\u201d Harris pledged to \u201cend\u201d the housing shortage, with no details of how she would do it. There was almost no attempt to address the social questions that so sharply defined the 2020 race, when Harris was selected as Vice-President. Then, Harris decried \u201cstructural racism,\u201d injustice in our criminal-justice system, and \u201cexcessive use of force by police.\u201d In sum, she concluded, \u201cthere is no vaccine for racism. We\u2019ve gotta do the work.\u201d The new Democratic Party platform also featured this dramatic shift, burying the fight for racial justice of 2020. For the first time since 2012, the Party\u2019s platform does not oppose the death penalty; it calls for more police, without emphasizing police reform.\n\nTo be sure, much has changed since 2020. But Harris is gambling that the millions of people who marched in search of resolution to the crisis of racism that year will simply move forward on this well-trodden path to the future. The Democratic Party is gambling that the nomination of a Black and Indian woman alone will satisfy the desires for racial justice. It is a risky strategy. The G.O.P. is prepared to flood the airwaves with an assortment of comments that Harris has made that will validate the \u201cliberal\u201d label. As one G.O.P. strategist put it, \u201cThe archive is deep.\u201d In Harris\u2019s previous run for President, she supported universal health care and free tuition for students at public colleges and universities. She raised the possibility of \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She opposed fracking and called for an end to juvenile incarceration.\n\nEven though Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren are among the most popular Democrats in the country, and an unabashed strategy of leveraging public dollars to rebuild the U.S. economy and promising to address racial discrimination produced one of the largest voter turnouts in American history, Harris and the Party leadership have acquiesced to the terms of the Republican backlash and rejected anything having to do with the successful 2020 election. Instead of explaining why she has supported these positions, in hopes of persuading an electorate desperate for change and possibly open to her reasoning, Harris is trying to reinvent herself on the fly."

            "headline": "U.S. Army Confirms Trump Staffer \u2018Pushed\u2019 Arlington Staffer Before Filming TikTok Ad",
            "text": "Donald Trump is facing new questions on Thursday about a stunt the former president filmed at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week. Photos of the 45th president giving a big thumbs up were the first to surface in an incredibly tacky, if typical, move for Trump. But new revelations from that day have been trickling out, including allegations of a physical altercation between Trump\u2019s staff and a staff member at Arlington, as well as the fact that Trump likely broke federal law while filming the ad at the cemetery.\n\nIt all started Monday when Trump appeared at Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony wreath for 13 U.S. military service members killed at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan during the American withdrawal in 2021. Federal regulations prohibit the filming of campaign commercials and the production of publicity material, but Trump brought along a crew to document his little stunt.\n\nAs the New York Times points out, Trump was in a heavily restricted part of the cemetery known as Section 60, which is primarily for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a staff member at Arlington approached his camera crew. There was a physical altercation, with Trump\u2019s staff insisting they should be allowed to film in the restricted area for their stupid little commercial.\n\nThe Arlington staff member has reportedly declined to press charges against Trump because it \u201ccould subject her to retaliation from Trump supporters,\u201d as the Times reports. And that\u2019s a reasonable fear, given the fact that Trump is the guy who tried to literally overthrow the U.S. government on January 6, 2021, and his followers are some of the most violent extremists around.\n\nThe Trump camp has tried to play down the incident and campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even slandered the Arlington staff member as mentally unstable on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump\u2019s team during a very solemn ceremony,\u201d Cheung told NPR.\n\nCheung added to NPR, \u201cWe are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made.\u201d But no footage showing details of the physical altercation has been released yet and NPR writes that when a reporter asked to see the footage, the Trump campaign declined.\n\nThe Army released a new statement about the incident on Thursday to defend the unnamed staff member at Arlington (ANC), who was simply trying to enforce the rules.\n\n\u201cParticipants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\u201d an unnamed Army spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation\u2019s fallen deserve,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe Trump campaign has released several staged videos from that day, and Trump himself says in one of the videos he\u2019s churned out for social media that, \u201cWe lost 13 people great, great people, what a horrible day it was,\u201d referring to the last day U.S. forces were officially in Afghanistan under wartime conditions. And then Trump insisted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose one person in 18 months and then they took over that disaster of leaving Afghanistan.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true, of course. The Associated Press fact-checked his claim back in 2022 and reported there was no 18-month period during his presidency without casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nBut all of that is really beside the point. Trump clearly broke the law by trying this idiotic move at a place widely revered as a site of quiet contemplation. As he does with everything, Trump turned it into a circus all about himself.\n\nThe law Trump broke by filming at the cemetery is 32 CFR \u00a7 553.32, according to the Washington Post, which prohibits any politician from engaging in political activity at the site. The newspaper talked with legal experts who emphatically explained that \u201cif the campaign was filming during the wreath-laying ceremony for partisan political activities, that would be a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked later in the day Thursday about the incident by NBC News reporter Dasha Burns. Incredibly, the former president played dumb, insisting \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about\u201d the TikTok video his team pushed out. That\u2019s obviously a lie. Trump then went on to say \u201cwe\u2019re leading the internet,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re so far above her on the internet,\u201d which are rather funny ways to talk about online spaces.\n\nBut the weirdest answer in his litany of untrue statements was the suggestion that the entire incident was somehow manufactured by his political opponents.\n\n\u201cThis was a set-up by the people in the administration, that, \u2018oh, Trump is coming to Arlington, that looks so bad for us\u2019,\u201d Trump said.\n\n@msnbc Former President Donald Trump defends his appearance at Arlington National Cemetery in an interview with @nbcnews Dasha Burns. During the interview, Trump suggests that someone outside his team might have been responsible for the video captured during his visit, despite it being posted on his campaign\u2019s TikTok account. @katiephang reacts. \u266c original sound \u2013 MSNBC \u2013 MSNBC\n\nTrump is struggling in the national polls, as he and Kamala Harris have just a little over two months before Election Day. And it\u2019s clear that Trump will do anything he can\u2014including breaking federal law\u2014in a desperate bid to retake power. With any luck, the former president will fail in those efforts. But things could get a lot weirder before they get any better on November 8."

Jetzt deutete er einen Sexskandal an.\n\nDonald Trump versucht weiter, mit derben Kommentaren die Aufmerksamkeit im US-Wahlkampf auf sich zu ziehen. Auf der von ihm mitbegr\u00fcndeten Plattform \"Truth Social\" waren Andeutungen zu lesen, wonach sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten die politische Karriere von Kamala Harris bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten.\n\nAnspielungen auf Sex-Skandal von Bill Clinton\n\nIn dem Post des republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Harris zu sehen, auf dem sie neben der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton steht. Dazu der Kommentar: \"Lustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben ...\"\n\nDie Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sexskandal, in den Clintons Mann und Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 bis 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Die Andeutungen sind in dem Post nicht mit Quellen belegt, werden aber dennoch von Trump-Anh\u00e4ngern geteilt.\n\nTrump verfasste den Beitrag nicht selbst. Dass er ihn auf seinem offiziellen Truth-Social-Account verbreitete, ist dennoch bemerkenswert. Der Republikaner verunglimpft seine demokratische Gegnerin im Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Unter anderem bezeichnet er sie als \"verr\u00fcckt\" und \"dumm\".\n\nTrump hat Harris auch schon mit Blick auf ihre Hautfarbe und Herkunft attackiert und unter anderem behauptet, die 59-J\u00e4hrige sei \"vor einigen Jahren pl\u00f6tzlich schwarz\" geworden. Verbale Angriffe sexueller Art haben eine neue Qualit\u00e4t.\n\nBei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Chicago kommentierte Trump die Hautfarbe von Kamala Harris.\n\nImmer wieder pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe - trotz Mahnungen\n\nMehrere Republikaner hatten Trump zuletzt \u00f6ffentlich dazu geraten, weniger pers\u00f6nliche Attacken gegen Harris von sich zu geben, sondern mehr inhaltliche Punkte zu machen. Trump wurde k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Pressekonferenz auf diese Mahnungen angesprochen, tat solche Ratschl\u00e4ge jedoch ab.\n\n\"Ich glaube, ich habe ein Recht darauf, sie pers\u00f6nlich zu attackieren\", sagte der 78-J\u00e4hrige mit Blick auf Harris und den Wahlkampf und schob nach: \"Ich muss es auf meine Art machen.\"\n\nSchon im Wahlkampf 2016 hatte Trump mit einer vulg\u00e4ren Aussage f\u00fcr Furore gesorgt, dass er Frauen \u00fcberall anfassen k\u00f6nne, auch zwischen den Beinen. Die Amerikaner w\u00e4hlten ihn damals trotzdem zum Pr\u00e4sidenten."

            "headline": "Ahead of key interview, five questions Kamala Harris hasn\u2019t answered yet",
            "text": "From the Gaza war to immigration to inflation, Harris is yet to spell out how she will accomplish her agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris will sit down for her first major broadcast interview since she became the face of the Democratic Party following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nShe will be joined by her running mate, Tim Walz, for the interview with CNN.\n\nUntil now, Harris has taken a cautious approach towards the press, much like Biden, who has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than any of the past seven US presidents, Axios reported, citing presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar.\n\nHarris\u2019s own sparse engagement with the media has come under scrutiny, especially from the Republicans. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to do a news conference; she\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Republican challenger Donald Trump said during a news conference of his own on August 15.\n\nTo be sure, Harris has spoken on several key issues that polls suggest matter to American voters, in campaign rallies and policy speeches. But without the cross-questioning that an interview allows, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee\u2019s positions on critical subjects remain ambiguous.\n\nSo when is the interview and what are some of the questions Harris has yet to clearly answer?\n\nWhen is Harris\u2019s CNN interview?\n\nHarris will speak to CNN\u2019s anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash alongside the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, at 9pm (01:00 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t be silent\u2019 on Gaza: How will she speak up?\n\nOn July 26, following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, Harris pledged not to stay silent on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,\u201d she told reporters. Yet, simultaneously, she pledged unwavering commitment to Israel.\n\n''I have had an unwavering commitment to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel.'' US VP Kamala Harris says she expressed her 'serious concerns' to Israeli PM Netanyahu about the 'scale of human suffering in Gaza.' pic.twitter.com/1U0KErqiDL \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 26, 2024\n\nIn the month since she made this statement, however, Harris\u2019s relative silence on Gaza has come under fire from critics who have questioned whether Harris\u2019s policy on Israel\u2019s war will be any different from Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo far, the answer, many believe, seems to be a firm no.\n\nAmid speculation that she might at least consider using restrictions on arms sales to Israel as leverage to convince the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop massacres of Palestinians, her adviser on national security made clear that Harris had no such plans.\n\n\u201cShe does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\u201d Phil Gordon, the adviser, said on August 8.\n\n.@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law. \u2014 Phil Gordon (@PhilGordon46) August 8, 2024\n\nAt this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which was held from August 19 to August 22 in Chicago, Harris once again simultaneously pledged support for Israel and expressed sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the Democrats refused to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the convention, while the parents of an Israeli-American captive held in Gaza were allowed to take the stage.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters rallied outside the DNC venue on all three days but were blocked from marching too close to the venue by police. Many warned that they would not support Harris in the November vote unless she ends unconditional support for Israel.\n\nHow will she ban \u2018price gouging\u2019?\n\nOn August 16, Harris proposed a ban on \u201cprice gouging\u201d by food suppliers and grocery stores.\n\nPrice gouging refers to dramatically raising prices to \u201cunfair levels\u201d in response to short-term high demand or scarcity \u2013 often following disasters, such as flooding. While several states already restrict the practice for some goods considered essential, there is no federal law barring it.\n\nThe proposal could be popular. High grocery bill inflation is a key concern for many voters. Under Biden\u2019s administration, grocery prices have gone up by 21 percent as part of an inflation surge.\n\nBut Harris has not spelt out how exactly she would go about enacting this ban on price gouging, earning her backlash from political critics, as well as industry.\n\nIn a release last week, the Trump campaign called her plan an example of \u201ccommunist price controls\u201d.\n\nIndustrialists and economists also said the plan could do more harm than good.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan is vague, but a central part of it involves getting the US Congress to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging in food and grocery sectors, similar to legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last year.\n\nYet political analysts point out that such legislation has almost no chance of passing in Congress \u2014 raising questions about the sincerity of Harris\u2019s proposal.\n\nWill she build a border wall?\n\nHarris has flip-flopped on the topic of immigration.\n\nDuring the DNC, she pledged that she would sign the now-defunct bipartisan border security bill that Trump wanted to terminate out of fears that it would benefit Democrats.\n\nThis bill would have allocated $20m towards security measures at the southern border with Mexico. The bill also set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for the construction of a border wall that was a signature project undertaken by Trump, and criticised by many Democrats.\n\nIndeed, during Trump\u2019s administration, Harris had called the idea of the wall \u201cun-American\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, she wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won\u2019t make us any safer.\u201d\n\nWhen she declared her candidacy for her 2020 presidential race in 2019, she called the wall Trump\u2019s \u201cmedieval vanity project\u201d.\n\nBesides pledging support for the bill that funds the wall, there are other indicators of Harris\u2019s hardening stance on immigration, including campaign advertisements in which she supports the idea of more Border Patrol agents.\n\nThis shift comes amid efforts by Republicans to hold Harris responsible for a surge in undocumented migrants into the US, by describing her as Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nNEW AD: On the border, the choice is simple. Kamala Harris is fighting to fix our broken immigration system. Donald Trump is trying to stop her. pic.twitter.com/t200w8iAYv \u2014 Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 30, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s her position on Medicare for All?\n\nWhen Harris was a senator for California, she signed on as a co-sponsor for Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All legislation which called for a single-payer health insurance system to provide everyone in the US with comprehensive healthcare.\n\nHowever, Harris\u2019s economic plan this time is silent on Medicare for All. So, it is unclear if she still backs the idea or has dropped it entirely.\n\nWill Harris ban fracking?\n\nDuring her 2019 primary run, Harris had also pledged to ban fracking \u2013 the controversial technique of extracting oil and gas from shale rock by drilling the earth.\n\nThe practice causes earth tremors and has a high environmental cost since the procedure consumes large amounts of water, in addition to releasing methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nHowever, Harris seems to have taken a U-turn on fracking during her presidential campaign this year. In late July, her campaign officials confirmed that she will not seek to ban fracking if elected.\n\nTrump had invoked her 2019 anti-fracking stance to criticise her.\n\nThe Biden administration allowed fracking. Harris herself has not made a public statement about whether or not she will ban fracking if she rises to the top job."

No economist on earth will support it, strategist says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the U.S., and implementing his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports would make inflation surge, according to a Nobel-prize winning economist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Trump were actually able to get his agenda through, it would be a disaster,\u201d Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Bill Clinton, told Quartz in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStiglitz, who more recently was head of the International Economic Association, said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201chas been a very steady hand with a set of well-talked-through proposals from the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrump every other day changes his mind about something,\u201d Stiglitz said, arguing that Trump\u2019s planned 50% tariffs on Chinese goods would slam lower- and middle-income Americans. \u201cThose tariffs would create a significant increase in the cost of living, it would be a shock to the economy, and that inflation, in turn, would lead the Fed to raise interest rates.\u201d\n\nReducing America\u2019s dependence on China can\u2019t be done with a sledgehammer, Stiglitz said. \u201cThe Biden-Harris proposal for a 10% tariff is an important signal to the market: \u2018You\u2019d better think about diversifying your supply chain.\u2019 And that, I would call good economic management. Good economic policy is balancing multiple concerns, and that kind of balancing is what distinguishes Harris from Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the specifics of Harris\u2019 plans, from boosting the child tax credit to planning to build three million new homes, Stiglitz said \u201cthe bundle as a whole is moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThose are cumulative problems that have been unattended for 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand so you\u2019re not going to be able to solve them overnight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 plans would also address the growth of monopolies, which have been holding back U.S. innovation and driving prices higher, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the weaknesses in the U.S. economy over the past 20 years has been a significant growth in market power, and that increase in market power reduces innovation, increases inequality, and lowers real wages of ordinary Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been one aspect of [the Biden-Harris] economic policy that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Trump and Harris lies in their tax policies.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 [Trump tax cut] was an enormous tax cut for the millionaires, and actually a tax increase when it was fully implemented for a large fraction of Americans,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWhat we need to do is restore tax justice, increase the taxes on the billionaires who can obviously afford it, and help address some of the big problems of inequality that we have, like child poverty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s move to cut the corporate income tax from 28% to to 21% did nothing to improve U.S. competitiveness, it just increased stock buybacks, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cExtending [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and making them deeper would make a huge hole in the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, the reason why they expired in 2025 was because the deficit created by the tax bill was so large that even Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe irony of his policies is that while a lot of support for them may come from people who feel like the system has left them behind,\u201d Siglitz added, \u201chis proposal will leave them even more behind.\u201d"

            "text": "The official J.D. Vance Bad Press Tour keeps on rolling this week, as the Republican vice presidential hopeful faces scrutiny over 2021 comments he made bashing teachers without biological children, including American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten.\n\nAlready grappling with widespread backlash over another 2021 jab calling Democratic politicians and voters \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d Vance now must answer more questions about further comments he made during an October 2021 political event for the Center for Christian Virtue. \u201cSo many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they\u2019re people without kids trying to brainwash the minds of our children. That really disorients me and disturbs me,\u201d Vance said during the event. \u201cRandi Weingarten, who\u2019s the head of the most powerful teachers\u2019 union in the country, she doesn\u2019t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\u201d\n\nWeingarten is a lesbian, and introduced the public to her wife, Liz Margolies, in 2007. Vance\u2019s disparaging remarks, however, were also inaccurate: Weingarten, believed to be the first openly LGBTQ+ president of a major U.S. labor union, is stepmother to Margolies\u2019 biological children, and described herself as a \u201cmother by marriage\u201d last year when subjected to similar attacks on her motherhood by Vance\u2019s GOP colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nStill, Vance doubled down on, and falsely reframed, his own remarks while being interviewed on the tarmac outside the Trump-Vance campaign jet this week, as CNN reported. \u201cI didn\u2019t criticize Randi Weingarten for not having kids, I criticized her for wanting to brainwash mine,\u201d Vance claimed. Meanwhile, Weingarten responded in an MSNBC interview, calling his comments \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d\n\nA Viral Image Appears to Show Virulently Anti-LGBTQ+ VP Candidate J.D. Vance in Drag Content creator and podcast host Matt Bernstein posted the image to X and Instagram over the weekend.\n\nVance has not specifically stated in what way he believes Weingarten is \u201cbrainwashing\u201d his children. His statement at the Center for Christian Virtue event was made in the general context of \u201cthe ideology of the left,\u201d which Vance characterized as \u201ccontrol[ling] what our children learn.\u201d Similarly vague, yet apocalyptic, rhetoric about Weingarten and the AFT has proliferated on the right over the last several years. In a 2022 interview, former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Weingarten \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d and alleged that teachers\u2019 unions are \u201cthe most likely to take this republic down.\u201d Other Republican lines of attack have included the accusation that Weingarten and the AFT puppeteered the U.S.\u2019 COVID-19 policy, which Weingarten flatly denied and called \u201cwild allegations.\u201d"

            "headline": "Kamala\u2019s Moment",
            "text": "The Precise Time Department sounds like something from a story by Jorge Luis Borges, but it is a real subdivision of the US Navy. At the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris has her official residence, the department maintains the Master Clock with which all others in the military system are harmonized. At the end of the driveway that leads from the vice-president\u2019s house, there is a public display of these exact hours, minutes, and seconds set beside a huge ship\u2019s anchor, as though this superaccurate chronometer served to hold America steady and prevent it from coming unmoored. Such reassurance seems, of course, ever more illusory.\n\nThere is a melancholy evocation of the Master Clock and its merciless motions at the start of Promise Me, Dad (2017), Joe Biden\u2019s account of his public and private lives in 2014. Biden was then living at the Naval Observatory as vice-president to Barack Obama. Leaving the residence for his family\u2019s annual Thanksgiving gathering in Nantucket, he seemed momentarily mesmerized:\n\nI glanced at the squat, standing digital clock at the top of the driveway, as I had maybe a thousand times since we had moved into the official residence. Red numbers glowed, ticking away in metronomic perfection: 5:11:42, 5:11:43, 5:11:44, 5:11:45\u2026. Precise Time\u2014synchronized to the millisecond\u2014had been deemed an operational imperative by the Department of Defense, which had troops and bases in locations around the globe. 5:11:50, 5:11:51, 5:11:52.\n\nOur limousine was already accelerating out of the turn with an abrupt force that pushed me back into the soft leather seats. The clock was behind us in a flash, out of sight, but still marking the time as it melted away\u20145:11:58, 5:11:59, 5:12:00.\n\nFor Biden, time was melting away. He did not get to be his party\u2019s nominee for president in 2016, and that in turn meant that he would be too old to stand for a second term in 2024. Hard as he tried, he could not, in the end, escape the clock\u2019s relentless indifference to his desire to stay in power. But for Harris, the glowing red numbers that haunted Biden may mark the precise time. They have hurried her to a moment not just of personal destiny but of historic fate.\n\nHarris\u2019s rapid coronation as the Democratic candidate for the presidency is at once quite fortuitous and utterly timely. It might be called an accident that\u2019s been waiting to happen. An accident because were it not for a series of unprecedented events\u2014Biden\u2019s becoming the oldest president in US history, his disintegration in a live televised debate, Donald Trump\u2019s political resurgence after an attempted coup and personal resurrection after an attempted assassination\u2014neither she nor any other Black woman would have become the candidate of either of the two main parties. The time, in conventional wisdom, would not have been right. The voters would not have been ready. The clock would have to tick on through endless cycles before the day arrived when it would feel safe to have, at the top of the ticket, an embodiment of American power that was neither white nor male.\n\nAnd yet it was an accident waiting to happen because this conventional wisdom is itself out of sync with a nation in which white men make up just 30 percent of the population. This is the minority that benefits from a spectacular application of positive discrimination in the political sphere: it accounts for close to two thirds of officeholders. By contrast, only three Black women\u2014Shirley Chisholm in 1972, Carol Moseley Braun in 2004, and Harris in 2020\u2014have previously even sought a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and only three (including Harris) have served in the Senate. No Black woman has been elected as a governor, and only twenty-five have held other senior statewide offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, or secretary of state.\n\nTime shapes contemporary American politics in two additional ways\u2014anachronism and gerontocracy. Biden, because of who he is, seemed to embody both the superannuated nature of America\u2019s political class and its overrepresentation of white men of the baby boomer generation. Harris, because of who she is, is uniquely placed to call time on both these realities\u2014which means, first of all, calling time on Donald Trump. If she frames her campaign effectively, Harris can make Trump a throwback and herself the embodiment of a future that has already taken shape in American demography.\n\nThat campaign can and must be about the things that affect people\u2019s daily lives\u2014jobs, health care, education, the climate crisis. But ticking away underneath it is another kind of question: Who is a normal American now? Harris\u2019s choice of running mate suggests she is aware of this: the avuncular Minnesota governor Tim Walz has a gift for making progressive ideals seem familiar, ordinary, and rooted in down-home common sense. Meanwhile, Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, implicitly appeal to a more symbolic notion of representation: however complex and diverse American society might seem to be, its essential form is male, white, and at least culturally Christian. This has always been so in the past and must always be so in the future. If demography, and therefore democracy, is flowing away from this eternal truth, then democracy must be frozen in time. When Trump told a right-wing Christian audience on July 26 that if they vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d they \u201cwon\u2019t have to do it anymore,\u201d he was putting forward his own notion of the end of history. The changes that are making the US more ethnically diverse, less comfortably patriarchal, and less Christian will be permanently checked because the institutions of power will have been made safe from their effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the problem with Biden\u2019s candidacy was that, for vastly more benign reasons, it drew on a parallel idea of holding back a tide of change. Biden presented himself, not without reason, as a bulwark, the only immovable object that could stop the apparently unstoppable Trump. As the Democratic candidate, Harris has rightly taken up Biden\u2019s message that the election in November is, as the outgoing president put it in his address from the Oval Office on July 24, about \u201csaving our democracy.\u201d But her candidacy carries a much stronger resonance. It says that saving American democracy is not at all the same thing as preserving it.\n\nBiden used the metaphor made famous by John F. Kennedy when he became, at forty-three, the second-youngest president in US history: \u201cI\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\u201d But the torch of American democracy must be envisaged as a flickering flame. In her rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, Hillary Clinton spoke of how \u201cevery generation has carried the torch forward.\u201d It is not a secure and fixed inheritance that can be handed down as a bequest from one generation to the next. It is a dangerous and endangered idea that must always draw fuel from new sources. American democracy cannot be saved if it is not reimagined, deepened, expanded, and brought into line with contemporary American realities. It is open to Harris to embody the energy of that urgent updating. Indeed, she can scarcely do otherwise.\n\nIt would be good to live in a world where Harris\u2019s gender and ethnicity were irrelevant and where she was judged solely on her record and ideas. But if there is any such world, it does not include the US. Trump, Vance, and the Republican Party will not permit such a possibility. Their reactionary mindset is obsessed with human biology\u2014Harris, for them, is inescapably defined by her chromosomes. The idea of the reproduction of America through the generations is projected onto her body. So far as we know, none of the forty-five occupants to date of the Oval Office has given birth to a child\u2014but in Harris\u2019s case this nonevent is a neglect of biological duty that makes her, in Vance\u2019s words, one of the \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d who don\u2019t \u201chave a direct stake\u201d in the country\u2019s future. The point of this contention is precisely that it is a claim on the future. Tomorrow belongs to Vance and those who look and think like him.\n\nHarris does, of course, have children through her marriage to Doug Emhoff, but because she did not give birth to them, Vance cited her first among the ranks of \u201cpeople without children.\u201d This, crucially, excludes her from the norm and indeed makes her the prime example of those who \u201chate normal Americans for choosing family.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that Harris has failed to give birth; it is also that she has failed to be properly born. John Eastman, a coconspirator in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 election, sought the Republican nomination for California attorney general in 2010, the year Harris won that office. In August 2020 Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman protesting that \u201cbefore we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris\u2019 eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth.\u201d He claimed (on spurious constitutional grounds) that since (as he thought) Harris\u2019s parents were in the United States on temporary visas when she was born in October 1964, she\n\nowed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers\u2014Jamaica, in the case of her father, and India, in the case of her mother\u2014and was therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment as originally understood.\n\nAt the time Trump amplified this bogus allegation, describing Eastman as a \u201cvery highly qualified, very talented lawyer\u201d and remarking that\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI heard it today that she doesn\u2019t meet the requirements\u2026. I have no idea if that\u2019s right, I would\u2019ve\u2014I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026very serious.\n\nOn August 19, as the Democratic convention was opening, Trump returned to this theme, asking of the Democrats: \u201cI wonder if they knew where she comes from.\u201d In this upending of the idea of birthright, Harris has no right to be American because she was born wrong. If there\u2019s a genre underpinning the Republican disdain for Harris, it\u2019s a nativity play that has become a horror movie. In Eastman\u2019s narrative, she was already, at the very moment of her birth, a traitor to America, loyal to two foreign powers. According to Vance\u2019s rhetoric, this misbegotten woman has grown up to be the potential begetter of a sterile American future.\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been attacked with both these biological weapons. Barack Obama had to face down Trump\u2019s birther lies but not the other natalist assault as well. No one said he hated ordinary Americans because he had not brought his own pregnancy to term. Yet it is the very unprecedented nature of this double assault on her bodily being that also gives Harris an exceptional power. She knows how to deal with this stuff\u2014she has been doing so all her life, with considerable grace.\n\nIt seems telling that Trump has had to abandon his mocking nickname for her, Laffin\u2019 Kamala, presumably because of a belated realization that her laughter\u2014so different from his own cruel comedy\u2014seems to most people to express optimism, youthfulness, and a joy in life, all qualities that he (as well as Biden) so patently lacks. She politicizes the idea of being comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. And in that comfort, there is a paradoxical kind of potency. She can be extremely radical by presenting herself merely as what she is. For if Harris really is a \u201cnormal American\u201d (as of course she is), it can only be because the American norm has been transformed. It can be possible because the torch has already been passed not just to a new generation but to new forms of personal and collective self-definition.\n\nHarris is fluent in a kind of baby talk very different from the demented babble of the Republican assaults on her. She does not run from the politicization of her body\u2014she embraces it. She is, in the way she tells her own story, a child of struggle. In her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey (2019), the earliest memory she recounts is of \u201ca sea of legs moving about, of the energy and shouts and chants.\u201d She gives us an infant\u2019s-eye view of political activism, with her looking up from her stroller at the legs of fellow civil rights marchers. Her cutest baby anecdote is freighted with time and history: \u201cMy mother would laugh telling a story she loved about the time when I was fussing as a toddler. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 she asked, trying to soothe me. \u2018Fweedom!\u2019 I yelled back.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the only good moment in her primary campaign of 2019, Harris identified herself explicitly and indignantly as a Black child of the 1960s. She attacked Biden for his opposition to the policy of integrating school systems by busing pupils from Black families to white-dominated areas: \u201cYou know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Her campaign tweeted a picture of Harris as a little girl, her hair in pigtails tied with bows. It then produced T-shirts printed with this image and the words \u201c THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME .\u201d Childhood yarns are part of the grammar of American politics, but this one is different. It is more defiant than endearing, more confrontational than sentimental.\n\nThe image of a Black girl in pigtails has its own specific history. In 1954, just months after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found educational segregation to be unconstitutional, Scientific American published an article titled \u201cThe Biology of the Negro.\u201d It was written by Curt Stern, an influential geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley\u2014the same university to which Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had traveled from India to study nutrition and endocrinology. It followed a lecture Stern had delivered in 1946 under the title \u201cWhy Do People Differ?\u201d According to the historian of medicine Michael Yudell:\n\nThe program for the lecture pictured a cartoon with three girls, two of whom were white, one black. The local chapter of the NAACP objected to the picture of a shabbily dressed black girl in pigtails wearing boots flanked by two well-dressed white girls looking at the black girl and smiling.\n\nBut in 1964, just months before Harris was born, Look magazine published what became a famous painting by Norman Rockwell called The Problem We All Live With. It shows another little Black girl in pigtails, this time neatly dressed in all-white clothes that emphasize the color of her skin. She is six-year-old Ruby Bridges, walking determinedly to her first day at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans in 1960. Towering over her, so high that their faces are out of the frame, are four men identified by their yellow armbands as deputy US marshals. Behind Bridges is a wall splattered with the bloodred juice of a hurled tomato and graffitied in bold letters with the N-word. By inviting his viewers to see this painting as a reality \u201cwe all\u201d live with, Rockwell was saying this violence is every bit as American as his supposedly nostalgic images of a vanishing small-town way of life.\n\nWhen Harris produced her THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME T-shirts, she was invoking her own history as well as the image of Ruby Bridges. And what\u2019s striking about this is that \u201ca Norman Rockwell view of America\u201d is proverbial shorthand for a sanitized and sentimentalized version of the past. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear (2018), Trump\u2019s economic adviser Gary Cohn made this very accusation against the then president in a heated argument over the nature of contemporary America: \u201c\u2018Mr. President,\u2019 Cohn said, trying to summarize, \u2018You have a Norman Rockwell view of America.\u2019\u201d Harris, to the contrary, evokes a very different \u201cNorman Rockwell view of America,\u201d one in which racial violence and resistance are acknowledged as part of a shared reality.\n\nThe creation of \u201cthat little girl\u201d involved the making of a profound choice about American history\u2014and about its most toxic aspect: slavery. Of all the \u201cfirsts\u201d that Harris represents\u2014first female vice-president, first Black woman and first Indian American to contest the presidency\u2014the one that goes unspoken is that if she wins in November, she will be the first openly acknowledged descendant of slaves to lead America. In this identification there is a complex interplay between freedom and necessity. It can perhaps best be appreciated through the uncanny recurrence of the same Irish name in her genealogy and in Biden\u2019s: Finnegan or Finegan. It is Biden\u2019s mother\u2019s surname and a constant point of reference in his idea of who he really is. It lives on in the name of his granddaughter Finnegan. It is also the name of Harris\u2019s father\u2019s maternal grandmother, Miss Iris, a Black woman born, as he recalled in a 2020 essay, \u201cIris Finegan.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s parents split up when she was five, and her father subsequently had a limited place in her life. Donald Harris, a leftist critic of orthodox theories of underdevelopment, became the first Black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford\u2019s economics department. He wrote of Kamala and her sister, Maya, that \u201cmy one big regret is that they did not come to know very well the two most influential women in my life,\u201d Miss Iris and his other grandmother, Miss Chrishy. Donald reproduced with his essay a photograph of Miss Iris with a two-year-old Kamala on her knee. He recalled how\n\nwe drove up to Thatch Walk and worked our way, with lots of cuts and bruises, through the same cane fields where Miss Iris had run a thriving business in the \u201cgood ole days\u201d of sugar and, a long time before, had probably been part of a slave plantation.\n\nThis locates a potential American president in the fields where some of her ancestors were enslaved to the brutal task of cutting cane.\n\nIn this other history, a name like Finegan loses the meaning it has for Biden: a sense of continuity, an uncomplicated connection to a genetic heritage. These Irish ancestors cannot be assumed to be what they are to Biden\u2014heroic underdogs. Miss Chrishy was born Christiana Brown, and Donald Harris believes her to be a \u201cdescendant of Hamilton Brown.\u201d Hamilton Brown, who owned a large number of slaves in Jamaica and fiercely opposed abolition, was also Irish, born in County Antrim. But unlike John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Biden, and even Barack Obama, all of whom engaged in the public ritual of visiting Ireland to celebrate their ancestral roots, Harris would probably not want to celebrate her distant Finegan and Brown cousins.\n\nThis is because Blackness is seldom a free choice. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists at the end of July, Trump claimed that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d and had previously been identifying only with her Indian heritage. \u201cIs she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one but she obviously doesn\u2019t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she became a Black person.\u201d This was a lie\u2014Harris has always identified as Black. But it also revealed a certain kind of truth about one of the ways racism operates: Trump\u2019s attack on Harris was based on the assumption that she must be either Black or not Black.\n\nIt is easy for white Americans to pick an ethnicity\u2014Biden could have decided to identify with his French or English, rather than his Irish, heritage. It is easy for white Americans to tell little lies about their ancestry. Trump himself has more than once falsely claimed that his father, Fred, who was born in New York, was in fact born in Germany: \u201cMy father is German, was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany, so I have a very great feeling for Germany.\u201d Fred Trump himself claimed for some years that he was Swedish. Harris, on the other hand, could not cherry-pick from among her complex origins. Her mother was indeed born in India and lived there until she was nineteen. Yet Gopalan understood that her girls were not going to be perceived in America as Brahmins. As Harris puts it in The Truths We Hold:\n\nMy mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.\n\nThis is not a relishing of the openness of identity in America. It is something much more serious: an attempt to find the freedom within inevitability. Gopalan understood that her daughters could not escape the identity that a racist society would impose on them, including the history of enslavement that is part of their ancestry. What they could do is find the pride within that identity and embody the resistance that is the other side of that history.\n\nThey had to do this in an atmosphere of ferocious political engagement, in which these same questions of freedom and necessity were being hammered out within Black radicalism. Trump seeks to define Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d and there is no doubt that Republicans will delve into her parents\u2019 political stances in the 1960s to find evidence for this characterization. But it is the exact opposite of the truth. The radical left is a huge influence on Harris\u2014in the sense that she is part of a generational reaction against the revolutionary Black politics of the 1960s. She is a child of the revolution only in the sense that she grew up in its wreckage.\n\nThere is a figure in The Truths We Hold who is both named and not named, both intimately embraced and held at a distance. He is introduced as follows: Harris writes that San Francisco State University \u201chad a student-run Experimental College, and in 1966, another of my mother\u2019s dear friends, whom I knew as Uncle Aubrey, taught the college\u2019s first-ever class in black studies.\u201d We later learn that Aubrey\u2019s aunt, Regina Shelton, was a \u201csecond mother\u201d to Kamala and that \u201cwe shared a long-standing relationship of love, care, and connection\u201d to this extended family. Uncle Aubrey is not given his full name, Aubrey LaBrie. Nor does Harris say much about his politics.\n\nIn 2019 Harris told Molly Ball of Time that she remembered coming \u201cdown the stairs of her childhood house in Berkeley to see FREE BOBBY carved in wet cement, after the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was arrested.\u201d Her childhood world was that from which the Panthers emerged. In 1965 LaBrie, along with his brothers Huey and Abdul and other friends, founded a periodical called Black Dialogue. It was in part a cultural magazine, publishing stories, poems, and essays alongside graphic art by young Black painters. But it was also highly political, and Aubrey is listed as its \u201cpolitical editor,\u201d presumably responsible for its ideological direction. Its first issue appeared in the aftermath of the murder of Malcolm X and is \u201cproudly dedicated\u201d to his memory as a \u201cgreat leader and a greater MAN .\u201d\n\nIt was also produced immediately after the brutal police assault on peaceful civil rights marchers at Selma. It seethes with both the passion and the anguish of uncertainty that so many young Black activists felt in the face of such loss and violence. It despairs of the possibilities of looking to the two spheres that Kamala Harris would go on to inhabit\u2014the law and democratic politics\u2014to win justice:\n\nThe Black Americans are nauseated by the practices of the White community that are, to them, mockingly meaningless, hypocritical, dishonest and essentially amoral. These young Black people have no faith in the Constitution and no respect for the White man\u2019s law. Why should they? What has it done for them? The law is dispensed in a manner which makes it a great big atrocious lie. It is merely another weapon to use against them.\n\nAfter the Watts riots in Los Angeles in August 1965, when South Central LA became a combat zone and thirty-four people died, Black Dialogue published a call to arms by Aubrey LaBrie\u2019s younger brother Huey:\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters of Watts, how proud we are of you. You who burned the city of angels and shook the crumbling white power structure\u2026. The enemy called it a riot but we know that it was an insurrection. It was one battle in the \u201cwar of Armageddon\u201d or the war between the black and white. The blacks who participated in the insurrection introduced an extremely effective tactic of igniting fires to local parasitical white business communities. They were not rioters or hoodlums, they were guerrillas.\n\nThere is an irony here. The \u201cwar of Armageddon,\u201d as invoked in Black Dialogue, was almost certainly drawn from the preaching of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. But it now has no purchase on the American left or on mainstream Black politics. Where it does have a strong grip is on the dark imagination of Trumpism. The insurrectionist violence that Trump unleashed with the invasion of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was fed by the millenarian vision of a coming civil war, framed by many of its believers as a racial \u201cwar between the black and white.\u201d The Republican Party has moved into the orbit of apocalyptic tribalism. If you want to see a figure who represents the most definitive movement out of that orbit, look at Harris.\n\nHarris told Ball in 2019 that \u201cthe reality is that when you are the so-called minority you learn many languages, necessarily.\u201d She did not mean literal languages but rather the languages of power. Harris entered the very arenas her mother\u2019s friends and political allies had despaired of: the law, party politics, elective public office. She chose to believe what the previous generation could not\u2014that justice can be achieved by working from inside the existing institutional structures. It is an act of faith that critics of her work as a prosecutor and attorney general in California do not believe to be justified in practice by the way she used her power. She sought to uphold some wrongful convictions, threatened to prosecute parents of habitually truant children (a policy that disproportionately affected people of color), and even appealed a federal court ruling that California\u2019s death penalty is unconstitutional (in spite of her own complete repudiation of the death penalty). But her caution is not mere moderation or bland centrism. It comes from a complex personal and political navigation between the desire for freedom on the one side and the tight constraints of reality on the other.\n\nThat weighing of what is right against what is possible is the business of democracy, and Harris represents the way the left has accepted that difficult responsibility. American politics has ended up in a place where it is those on the right who want to burn everything down. They will do that, if they can, in the name of a phony American normality that excludes Harris and everyone who shares with her a complex identity. It is striking, therefore, that Harris\u2019s candidacy has given Democrats permission to point out how \u201cweird\u201d the Republicans\u2019 version of America really is. Walz put the word into circulation just days after Biden announced his departure from the national stage. In a punchy statement after Trump appeared on Fox News, the Harris campaign listed as one of the main takeaways: \u201cTrump is old and quite weird?\u201d The conjunction of these two qualities implies that what is truly strange is not just Trump\u2019s chronological age but the anachronistic vision in which only white men who plant their seed in fertile women are authentic citizens and legitimate rulers. Against that weirdness, we have the real possibility of a president whose history is synchronized with American reality.\n\n\u2014August 20, 2024"

            "text": "Yves here. At least some of whom are in the left are not accepting the premise that they must ignore the Democratic Party\u2019s sorry record and back Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd keep this point of view in mind:\n\nBy Robert Urie, author of Zen Economics, artist, and musician who publishes The Journal of Belligerent Pontification on Substack\n\n\u201cIf we lose, we\u2019ll be tried as war criminals.\u201d US General Curtis Lemay speaking of the US firebombing of Tokyo (and here) in WWII.\n\nIn addition to the war against Russia that the US launched with its coup in Ukraine of 2014, the next president of the US will have the US role in the genocide in Palestine to contend with. With respect to US relations abroad, it would be one thing if these conflicts had been forced on the US. But they weren\u2019t. They were chosen by the Biden-Harris administration as part of its too-little, too-late, recognition that US-based capital, Wall Street acting in league with subsidized industries like Big Tech, has destroyed the US economy for most workers, meaning citizens.\n\nOver the years, the position of Joe Biden with respect to China has been paradoxical. Or less charitably, incoherent. Biden joined with the (Bill) Clinton administration in 2000 to \u2018normalize\u2019 US trade relations with China so as to facilitate its entry into the WTO (World Trade Organization) in 2001. This followed Biden\u2019s support for NAFTA (1994), which established the institutional circumstances by which the American manufacturing base was handed over to China. It was decided that American workers would either be bond traders or fentanyl addicts. What they wouldn\u2019t be is industrial workers. Too many unions.\n\nGraphic: NATO was formed as a residual of American power in Europe following WWII. For the uninitiated, the US lost 400,000 people in WWII while the Russians, then Soviets, lost 27,000,000. In the present, as cover for, or denial of, US imperialism abroad, NATO has successfully changed the subject from domestic economic looting to \u2018Great Power politics.\u2019 Post-War ideological competition washed the ethos of Western imperialism, euphemisms and all, through the cleansing agent of theories that need never come into contact with their facts. Sources: US Embassy, Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Dr. Strangelove.\n\nThe outcome of five decades of neoliberal (capitalist) predation looks remarkably like Marxist analyses of the first half of the twentieth century had it. The GFC (global financial crisis) and the Great Recession that followed it led to a full recovery of the predatory economy, the one where raw political and economic power are used not simply to loot, but through lawfare, surveillance, and factionalized labor markets. to pin Americans under the repressive boot of unfettered capital. This is the world that the Biden-Harris administration was appointed to perpetuate.\n\nThe political analog, possibly easier to see because it is fresh in the minds of Americans, is the gathering of oligarch donors to select Kamala Harris to be the Democrats\u2019 candidate for president. The fake emergency regarding Joe Biden\u2019s age\u2014 the man was widely understood to be unable to distinguish fact from fantasy (and here) forty years ago, was used to render visible the class dynamic that has a tiny cabal of corporate welfare queens and trust-fund opportunists openly and explicitly determining Federal policy.\n\nMaps: the Russian complaint that NATO surrounded its western border after the US, Germany, and France individually and jointly promised not to, is an abstraction to Americans. In fact, the US has an answer to the question of what would happen if the Russians took actions similar to the US. It was called the Cuban Missile Crisis. Impressively, the story that Americans have been told about it is total bullshit. Not only had the Americans secretly placed nuclear weapons aimed at Moscow in Italy before the Russians sent weapons to Cuba, but word had it (link above) that JFK only had a fraction of the information that he needed regarding the US actions that precipitated the crisis. Source: cnbc.com.\n\nWhile the capitalist press loves to tout the self-made nature of \u2018wealth\u2019 in the US, the richest of the Forbes 400 all saw their fortunes multiplied by the Federal Reserve\u2019s relentless drive to raise the prices of financial assets since 2008. For example. Microsoft has a business that produces computer hardware and software. But it also has shares in the company that trade in financial markets. To the extent that Microsoft\u2019s shares trade above the value of Microsoft as a going concern, wealth \u2018creation\u2019 is illusory. What is achieved in financial markets is redistribution upwards, not wealth creation.\n\nThis was / is part of the problem created by the Wall Street bailouts of 2008. Shares are owned by the rich. If memory serves, 90% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of the population. Of this 10%, the very rich own a large preponderance of these shares. The American myth that people get rich by creating social (economic) value misses that in a financialized economy, the Federal Reserve plays a major role in economic distribution. Since 2008, the Fed has labored nonstop to make the very rich much, much, richer.\n\nGraph: Democrats have a choice of crediting the phenomenal rise in the wealth of the very rich during the Biden-Harris administration to either the business acumen of the billionaire class or to the actions of the Federal Reserve. The graph clearly illustrates an \u2018exogenous\u2019 driver of the rise in wealth\u2014 the Federal Reserve. Otherwise, the results would be mixed. Capitalist economists credit the entire rise in the wealth of the rich to business acumen. Here is the Forbes 400 list. Please read Forbes\u2019 explanation of this argument to understand why this is a problem for the rest of us. Source: inequality.org.\n\nThis all ties back to the subject at hand, electoral politics in the US, through the role that wealthy donors just played in the elevation of Kamala Harris to be the Democrats\u2019 candidate for president. Again, if great wealth indicated a greater social contribution, that would have one meaning. But what it indicates in this case is that an agency of the Federal government made it its mission to make already rich people much, much, richer. This is part of the argument for why Barack Obama was a disaster as president. He rebuilt this rigged system whereby all social wealth is institutionally organized to flow upwards. And that is why oligarchs are supporting the Democrats.\n\nIt is US foreign policy that ties this post-bailout economic dysfunction to the empire-in-decline-that-is-acting-out-abroad that the US now represents. Readers are welcomed to agree or disagree with the characterizations of US foreign policy presented here. But what you can\u2019t disagree with are the facts. A team of professional liars, prevaricators, and bullshit artists were apparently assigned to countering the fact that the Russians were repeatedly told by US and European officials that NATO would be kept away from Russia\u2019s border. As the second graph up illustrates, between 1990 and 2023, NATO has surrounded Russia\u2019s western border with the exceptions of Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nIrrespective of whether or not you agree with the Russian position on the matter, the Russians have a legitimate grievance under any reasonable reading of this history. But what was it that elevated a thirty-year-old (dis)agreement to geopolitical relevance in 2022? That would be the 2014 US-led coup in Ukraine (link above) in which the US assumed control of the Ukrainian political system. Here is the infamous phone call in which Americans Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt selected the post-coup Ukrainian government. The people that Nuland said that she would put in office were put in office.\n\nFollowing the US-led coup in Ukraine and the selection of the post-coup government by American neocons, the CIA built permanent facilities on the Ukrainian border with Russia with which to surveil and attack the Russians. Further, as (Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs) Victoria Nuland put it in 2022, eight years after the US-led coup in Ukraine took place, Ukraine was (is) loaded to the gills with bioweapons labs. Whatever their genesis (Soviet, US), the US had controlled Ukraine for nearly a decade before Nuland admitted their existence.\n\nGraphic: it is telling to see how openly and crudely racist Israelis are toward Palestinians in their social media posts. While seeing the Israelis channeling their inner Nazis has a depressing, Freudian, quality to it, seeing Americans like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump doing everything in their power to perpetuate a racist genocide is even sadder, if not quite as Freudian. Presumably, Biden \u2013 Harris wouldn\u2019t be engaged in such an act unless they thought it to be in the strategic interest of the US. But if this were the case, why is every word they say about it be a lie? Sources: al Jazeera English, Wikipedia.\n\nWith respect to the US \u2013 Israeli genocide currently underway in Palestine, Kamala Harris recently repeated the materially false Biden administration \u2013 Israeli state narrative around the Hamas attack inside Israel on October 7, 2023. As a recent analysis by Haaretz revealed, a material proportion\u2014 up to half, of the Israelis killed on October 7 were killed by the IDF (Israel Defense Force) under the Hannibal Directive issued by the Israeli political leadership. Further, the claims that Hamas used sexual violence\u2014 the \u2018mass rape\u2019 narrative, has been debunked by reporters at The Grayzone (see here, here, here).\n\nThe social dynamic that this factionalized \u2018truth\u2019 creates is of political cults that believe every word handed them by people they trust, as they discount every word uttered by those in competing political cults. Instead of wielding political power, the members of these cults exist to trade group-affirming talking points on social media, exhibiting little awareness that the leaders of both cults work for the same corporate chieftains and oligarchs. Or if not the exact same corporate chieftains and oligarchs, those who hold similar political \u2013 economic roles in different cults.\n\nThat Kamala Harris knew, or should have known, that what she was telling her constituents about the US conflicts in Palestine and Ukraine is untrue has political importance. Because she is an allegedly functioning adult who is vying for an official position of power in a major nation, she should know the facts of these conflicts. That there was no distance between her recitation of fake facts and that of the Pentecostal wing of the Republican party illustrates the conundrum. A necessary first step to solving problems is to understand their causes.\n\nThe model on which the US and Israeli responses to October 7 appear to be based is 9/11. Readers will recall that the George W. Bush administration was never made to give sworn testimony to the 9/11 commission regarding its knowledge of events, and 2) was allowed to redact the pages of the Report issued by the commission that implicated the Saudis in the attacks. Both decisions were superficially defensible. There is a separation of powers issue with compelling sworn testimony from a sitting president. And the Saudis were (in theory) US allies, in addition to being business partners with the Bush family.\n\nLittle need be said with respect to the fact that fewer than half of Americans believe the official explanation of 9/11, or that about half of Americans (link above) believe that the Federal government of the US was behind the attacks. While this may be interesting, it isn\u2019t the point. The Bush administration entered office in 2001 intent on launching a war against Iraq. In addition to redirecting attention away from the Saudis, Bush attributed knowingly false motives for the 9/11 attacks to the Iraqis. Here is (Saudi national) Osama bin Laden explaining why al Qaeda attacked the US on 9/11.\n\nAlong with Wall Street\u2019s implosion of the economy in 2008, public disillusion over the US war in Iraq represents a lynchpin in the imperial decline that the US is now decades into. George W. Bush lied the people who historically have fought American wars into going to Iraq based on false claims about why they were doing so. Bush\u2019s \u2018pre-emptive war\u2019 relied on a credible threat having been posed by Iraq that simply did not exist. Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11captures the psychological panic that the Bush administration successfully conjured to coerce Americans into fighting its war.\n\nBut actions have consequences. Having been lied into losing lives, limbs, and / or killing Iraqi civilians to put another dollar or two on Halliburton\u2019s stock price, much of the soldier class was subsequently foreclosed on and / or rendered unemployed by Wall Street. These are the people that American liberals and \u2018the Left\u2019 were calling \u2018fascists\u2019 2016 \u2013 present because they wouldn\u2019t vote for the people who lied them into the war in Iraq and then took their houses as their jobs were systematically disappeared in the Great Recession.\n\nEach of these acts undertaken against the interests of the American people features one or more groups or actors that purposely undertook them to enrich themselves and / or to accrue power. Neither the US war in Iraq, the GFC, nor the Great Recession, were facts of nature. They were each caused by the acts of some humans seeking to benefit from taking from other humans. In class terms, these were the actions of the rich preying on the rest of us. Each act had systemic drivers requiring institutional mediation. The rich have organized the US to vacuum up social wealth for their own benefit.\n\nThe ready-made genocide, genocide-in-a-box if you will, that the US and Israel have engaged in in Palestine since October 7, 2023 never looked like a response to the attack by Hamas. It has looked like an effort to exterminate the people of Gaza since it began. Supporting this interpretation have been Israeli Zionists who have said straightforwardly(and here, here, here, here) and repeatedly that \u2018clearing\u2019 Palestine of Palestinians is the goal. Here is Israeli Zionist Chanamel Dorfman, aide to Israeli Defense Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, complaining that the Nazis killed the wrong people. Is this really an argument worth making?\n\nGraphic: Some, possibly many, readers will be offended by conflation of Kamala Harris\u2019s likely policies with those of the Biden administration. After all, she\u2019s her own person, runs the logic. However, ensuring that Harris isn\u2019t her own person was the entire point of the oligarchs (donors) interviewing her before elevating her as their candidate. They wouldn\u2019t have elevated her if they hadn\u2019t liked what they heard in the interviews. More than anything else, it is this idea of personality-driven politics that unites American liberals with their fascist forebears. As long as hippie-earth-mother is willing to slaughter a million Palestinians for Israeli fascists, hire her! That doing so means that she never was hippie-earth-mother won\u2019t be understood until after the money has been deposited in the bank.\n\nSo, when Kamala Harris repeats largely or fully debunked charges of Palestinian crimes on October 7 as if they really happened while ignoring evidence that the Israelis are knowingly and intentionally acting to exterminate the Palestinian people in Palestine, possible explanations include that she is misinformed, knowingly lying, or that she is incapable of separating truth from fiction. Alternatively, if the truth supports her position on the war, why is she lying? The reasonable inference to draw is that Harris knows that the truth doesn\u2019t support her position.\n\nChart: the great mystery of US foreign policy has finally been solved. Quickly, what is it that unites Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and Libya in the minds of US foreign policy officials? Well, the officials\u2014 most of whom are currently engaged in a racist genocide in Palestine, would say that these nations are all \u2018authoritarian.\u2019 With billionaire donors and the CIA currently \u2018overseeing\u2019 American elections, the contrast that gave the fear of fascism its punch is looking more like a merging of interests. Source: worldometers.info.\n\nReaders will recall that the George W. Bush administration wove the alleged facts of 9/11 into its policy decision to launch a war against Iraq. The purpose was to frame the war as defensive when it was an offensive war. It wasn\u2019t until no weapons of mass destruction had been found and the war was coming unwound (2005) that a single true fact regarding 9/11 or the war could be uttered in the US. Further, with \u2018loyalty oaths\u2019 (to their administration) required for citizens to gain admittance to public rallies featuring government officials, the Bush administration understood the fascist roots of its political program.\n\nWhat Harris\u2019s statement (link above) regarding events in Palestine and Ukraine indicates is that she has fully internalized the lies emanating from US and Israeli officials regarding US foreign policy, and that she will act as if they are true if she is elected president. As with the KKK using emotive terms like \u2018international Jewry\u2019 to signify group allegiance, the Democrats have a fully developed internal discourse around US foreign policy that is unquestioned and unquestionable. It was hardly ironic then that Joe Biden was George W. Bush\u2019s point man in selling the false story of Iraq\u2019s WMDs to Democrats.\n\nWith all that is, and isn\u2019t, being said by leading Democrats about the wars in Ukraine and Palestine, it is the facts on the ground that future US political leaders will be forced to reckon with. Russia\u2019s western border is zero miles from Ukraine, whereas Washington DC is 5,000 miles from Kiev. US weapons and materiel are fussy and ludicrously expensive. Russian weapons and materiel are robust and designed to maximize lethality, versus the US goal of maximizing profits for the MIC. In other words, it was capitalism that rendered the American MIC considerably worse than useless.\n\nUS participation in the genocide in Palestine recalls the arguments of philosophers and scholars following WWII that what it was that differentiated the Holocaust from ordinary history was the effort by the Nazis to exterminate a people\u2014 the Jews. However, reading the quote from US General Curtis LeMay above regarding the firebombing of Tokyo, which he led, doesn\u2019t impart a sense of a self-evident moral difference between Allied actions in WWII and those of the Axis Powers. Lemay didn\u2019t see one, at any rate.\n\nWithin the frame of \u2018military valor\u2019 (that is not endorsed here), LeMay was an actual hero in WWII. The firebombing of Tokyo that he led burned 100,000 Japanese civilians alive on its first night. All told, the firebombing of civilian populations in Japan ended up killing between 330,000 and 900,000 people. Additionally, the allies bombed civilian populations in Germany relentlessly, with the bombing of Dresden being one of the better-known cases.\n\nFrom the perspective of the present, civilian deaths from American wars are plausibly viewed as \u2018collateral damage.\u2019 But they aren\u2019t collateral\u2014 meaning unintended even if predictable, because the civilians were intentionally targeted. Here, Osama bin Laden explains why he believed that American civilians were legitimate targets in the 9/11 attacks. For Americans who imagine that the illusion of democracy, fake democracy if you will, protects them from political reprisals for US actions taken abroad, the bin Laden letter is essential reading.\n\nDuring the Cold War, General LeMay advocated pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the USSR (now Russia) and China (link above) while the US still had a strategic advantage by way of its larger nuclear arsenal. This didn\u2019t mean \u2018strategically\u2019 or \u2018surgically\u2019 striking Command Centers\u2014 it meant slaughtering half-a-billion civilians\u2014while they were wholly or partially defenseless. How then were Americans in 1965 morally horrified by the Holocaust when in ordinary conversations they advocated forcefully for the murder of half-a-billion innocents?\n\nThe lesson that the so-called intelligence agencies learned through the psychological manipulation of the American public during the Cold War was that once the groundwork\u2014 the instilling of unreasoned fears, had been laid, Americans would agree to pretty much anything. Even after no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq and the war had turned into the predictable catastrophe that it was, most Americans still found inane drivel about \u2018freedom\u2019 attached to the war to be compelling. To money-shot from the epoch: \u2018freedom ain\u2019t free.\u2019\n\nAn aspect shared between Zionism and Nazism is the conceptual shift from the general claim of peoples with rights as such to the claim that particular peoples are special, and therefore deserve special rights. Following WWII, the argument was put forward that it was the Nazi effort to exterminate an entire people\u2014 the Jews, that separated the Holocaust from ordinary history. The Zionist shift from the defense of the rights of \u2018peoples\u2019 to the special rights of Jews recreated a variation on the racial case claimed by the Nazis.\n\nThe Nazis held retrograde racial views (borrowed from American eugenicists) that they claimed distinguished them from the rest of humanity. The Zionist claim is that Jews are God\u2019s chosen people, and that this distinguishes them from the rest of humanity. The Nazi\u2019s \u2018Thousand-year Reich\u2019 lasted about fifteen years. This is evidence against the claim that the Nazis possessed superior racial qualities. Likewise, if the Jews are God\u2019s chosen people, why not leave the public assertions of this fact to their God? In fact, like American Pentecostals, they don\u2019t trust their own God to follow scripture as they have interpreted it.\n\nThe practical problem with both theories is that there are about eight billion humans on the planet, most of whom are on the wrong side of Nazi / Zionist supremacy. That Democrats can\u2019t see American racial history in the Zionist\u2019s treatment of Palestinians might be bizarre if it weren\u2019t so politically convenient. In 2024, American Democrats, led by the senior leadership of their party, are consciously and knowingly supporting a genocide against a racial, religious, and ethnic minority in Palestine. This makes them racists engaged in a racist genocide.\n\nThe social destruction being caused by both American conflicts ties to this latter point. WWI begat WWII. Further, it was the Biden administration\u2019s decision to place these conflicts within the broader frame of economic competition between nations. Anyone who has followed the environmental back-and-forth of recent years knows that renewed imperial competition has been underway for decades now. A race is on by the US to secure the resources needed to fulfill the Democrats\u2019 EV fantasies. As usual, the effort is bounded by too-convenient assertions that they can\u2019t cross \u2018their\u2019 donors because Trump!\n\nGraph: the Biden administration\u2019s claim that it engineered a major recovery in manufacturing employment in the US isn\u2019t a reason to uncork the champagne just yet. The facts are that \u2018the Biden miracle\u2019 was a reflexive recovery following the catastrophe of the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden\u2019s real contribution to manufacturing employment came through his support for NAFTA. Additionally, Biden supported the normalization of trade relations with China that facilitated China\u2019s admission to the WTO in 2001. Together, these caused the precipitous decline from 19.5 million manufacturing workers in 1980 to 13 million today. Source: Federal Reserve of St. Louis.\n\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald has done a respectable job of identifying and commenting on the delusion, ignorance, and hypocrisy of the young Democrats now rushing to support Harris. As was the case with young Democrats in 2020, the response is Pavlovian. Good dog. What a good dog. Now, rollover and play dead. While the officials of various Federal agencies must be beaming with pride at their ability to manipulate electoral politics with such finesse, they have created the political equivalent of highly processed foods.\n\nAs the current American political leadership effectively demonstrates, capitalists favor having compliant, not-bright, people holding public office to do their bidding. This isn\u2019t to suggest that a cabal of evil geniuses is running things. Having met and had long conversations with many very rich people, the only class dumber than the US political class are the oligarchs. What part of the nuclear annihilation that Biden-Harris are working so hard to bring about in Ukraine don\u2019t Harris\u2019s oligarch benefactors understand?\n\nTying this back to economics for a moment, the Democrat\u2019s focus on child \u2018influencers\u2019 in Chicago was more than just political marketing. Following from 1990s Republican neoliberal Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract with America, influencers, Uber drivers, cashiers, fentanyl dealers, financial advisors, crypto speculators, disinformation specialists, personal shoppers, bud-tenders, and dog-walkers represent the culmination of the Democrats\u2019 industrial policy. So no, your \u2018career\u2019 picking up dog crap in the street (\u2018piece work\u2019) isn\u2019t how your grandparents raised a family.\n\nThe lever for Greenwald\u2019s critique (above) is incongruity\u2014 the fact that reconciliation by the young with the party of Genocide Joe appears to have been so quick and easy. The \u2018Hitler Youth\u2019 quality of the conversion was / is impressive. However, what is the alternative? Toll-booth Zionist Trump! has already committed to the pay-as-you-go slaughter of Palestinians funded by Miriam Adelson. The only antiwar candidate in the upcoming is Jill Stein, whom the Democrats have successfully marginalized. But if you\u2019re going to vote, Stein is the best (only) hope for the US.\n\nIn fact, the purpose of the American one-party system, the uniparty, is to ensure that nothing changes. Or rather, the faces change, but the policies stay the same. The hope held by Democrats that Harris\u2019s policies will be less genocidal than Biden\u2019s misses that the only people who interviewed her before she was elevated to be their candidate for president were donors. In fact, the donors are the glue that holds the uniparty together. How else could, marketing chatter aside, Biden and Trump have nearly identical policies?\n\nFinally, not a word of this essay is anti-American. Opposing US foreign policy\u2014 the product of an antique and decrepit MIC filtered through the corrupt and dysfunctional American system of political graft, is to argue that the policies of officialdom run counter to the larger interests of the US and the world. Anti-Americanism is precisely what the George W. Bush administration engaged in when it lied the US into war with Iraq.\n\nFurther, the Germans are still apologizing for the Nazis seven decades after they were defeated in WWII. The Biden administration\u2019s choice to emulate the Nazis by engaging in racist genocide likewise will have one meaning in the short term, and quite another in the longer term. As I wrote in multiple essays before the 2020 election, Joe Biden, like George W. Bush before him, is the embodiment of imperial decline. Kamala Harris represents an effort to put a fresh face on the same old imperialist foreign policy. You can understand this now or three years from now. The choice is yours."

            "text": "Official Trailer for 'Paris Has Fallen' Action Series with Tewfik Jallab\n\n\"When the city falls, heroes will rise.\" Studiocanal has launched an official trailer for their upcoming action series called Paris Has Fallen, streaming in France first this fall. This is a TV continuation of the \"Has Fallen\" franchise of movies - which includes Olympus Has Fallen (2013), London Has Fallen (2016), Angel Has Fallen (2019). While we wait for the next Night Has Fallen movie, it's time to head to Paris for another dangerous mission. A protection officer and an MI6 operative team up after a terrorist attack in Paris. They suspect a mole as they race to thwart a larger conspiracy threatening Paris. The plot follows protection officer Vincent Taleb who finds himself working with street-smart MI6 agnet Zara Taylor to save the day. Starring Tewfik Jallab, Ritu Arya, and Sean Harris as the main bad guy, with Ana Ularu, Camille Rutherford, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Covillault, Emmanuelle Bercot, Karl Collins, and Nathan Willcocks, and others. No idea why they needed to make a series from this action franchise, but why not I guess? Wasn't Sean Harris already a villain in a Mission Impossible film? Alas this doesn't look as good as any of the films.\n\nHere's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Studiocanal's series Paris Has Fallen, direct from YouTube:\n\nWhen a terrorist group led by Jacob Pearce (Sean Harris) attacks a high-profile event, with the French Minister of Defence as their target, protection officer Vincent Taleb (Tewfik Jallab) finds himself working with street-smart MI6 operative Zara Taylor (Ritu Arya) to save the day. But when events take a dark turn, Vincent and Zara soon realize that the plan extends beyond just one politician. When they suspect that one of their colleagues in the security services is feeding information to Jacob, Vincent and Zara find themselves needing to rely only on each other. Increasingly isolated and with Jacob always one step ahead, can this unlikely pair stop Paris from falling to a man hell-bent on vengeance? Paris Has Fallen is a new series created and written by Howard Overman, a writer on the series \"Vexed\", \"Merlin\", \"Misfits\", \"Atlantis\", \"Crazyhead\", \"Future Man\", \"The One\", \"War of the Worlds\" previously. With episodes directed by Hans Herbots and Oded Ruskin. Produced by Johnny Capps, Julian Murphy, Howard Overman. Exec produced by Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Greenstein, Avi Lerner, Yariv Lerner, Jonathan Yunger, Oded Ruskin, Alan Siegel. Studiocanal will debut Paris Has Fallen on Canal+ in France starting September 23rd, 2024."

Beide Kandidaten, Donald Trump und Kamala Harris, k\u00e4mpfen um die entscheidenden Stimmen. Doch welche Taktiken setzen sie ein, um ihre Gegner zu schlagen, und welche Themen k\u00f6nnten den Ausschlag geben? Darum geht es in dieser Folge von \u201eThis is America\u201c.\n\nNach dem Ende der Parteitage beginnt nun die entscheidende Phase, in der beide Kandidaten alles daransetzen, ihre W\u00e4hlerbasis zu mobilisieren und unentschlossene W\u00e4hler in den wichtigen Swing States zu \u00fcberzeugen.\n\nDer Wahlkampf wird von beiden Seiten zunehmend aggressiv gef\u00fchrt. Besonders interessant ist, wie beide Seiten ihre Strategien anpassen, um die Schwachstellen des Gegners auszunutzen.\n\nTrump greift Harris pers\u00f6nlich an\n\nTrump setzt \u2013 auch gegen den Willen seiner Partei \u2013 bislang vor allem auf pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe auf Kamala Harris. Im Podcast diskutieren US-Korrespondentin Stefanie Bolzen und WELT-Redakteurin Antonia Beckermann dar\u00fcber, warum Trump nach wie vor Schwierigkeiten zu haben scheint, Harris effektiv anzugreifen, ohne dabei als rassistisch oder frauenfeindlich wahrgenommen zu werden.

            "headline": "Laughing at Trump",
            "text": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nDemocrats are lately employing a strategy against Donald Trump that he has been using effectively against his opponents for years: mockery. It started with the vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz calling Trump \u201cweird\u201d and then bloomed into a bouquet of insults at the Democratic convention: unserious, self-involved, entitled, obsessed with crowd sizes, \u201cfell asleep at his own trial.\u201d Where did this strategy come from? Will it remain effective? And can it backfire?\n\nIn this episode, we talk with the Atlantic staff writer David Graham, who was at the Democratic convention and also covers Trump. And we talk with a surprising muse for the politics of mockery: Conservative lawyer and activist George Conway has been using targeted mockery against Trump for years, with unusual success. He reflects on what it means for Democrats to adopt this strategy.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nBarack Obama: There\u2019s the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. [Crowd laughter]\n\nHanna Rosin: The sight last week at the Democratic National Convention of Barack Obama, the dignified statesman and 44th president of the United States, up on stage, looking down at his two hands as he made a joke about Trump\u2019s, ahem, size.\n\nObama: It just goes on and on and on. [Applause]\n\nRosin: That was a revelation to me. In 2016, as Donald Trump was doling out belittling nicknames and insults, Michelle Obama famously told her fellow Democrats, When they go low, we go high.\n\nAnd then in the last month, it\u2019s like a whisper campaign went out among Democrats: Climb on down. Just say it. Say on a national stage that thing that you\u2019ve been saying to your friends, Michelle.\n\nMichelle Obama: Who\u2019s gonna tell him that the job he\u2019s currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?\n\nRosin: In fact, if you want to, you can even rhyme it, Bill.\n\nBill Clinton: He mostly talks about himself, so the next time you hear him, don\u2019t count the lies. Count the I\u2019s.\n\nRosin: It\u2019s not that politicians haven\u2019t insulted each other for centuries. They do, and they have. Some insults stick; some don\u2019t. It\u2019s part of the game. But with the exception of Trump, I\u2019ve never seen a political strategy of insults dominate an entire party and take off so thoroughly and quickly and gleefully. It\u2019s like ever since Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz said the word weird\u2014Trump is weird. J. D. Vance is weird. Their policies are weird\u2014a door opened up, and Democrats rushed right through it.\n\nNow, in other countries that deal with authoritarian leaders, mockery is a known strategy, a way of deflating a leader\u2019s too-big ego. It can be really effective, also possibly dangerous. And of course, it can backfire.\n\nHere in the U.S., though, it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t fully explored yet. So today is a two-part show. First, we\u2019ll talk to Atlantic staff writer David Graham, who was at the convention and covers Trump and so is the perfect person to help us dissect the politics of mockery, where they came from, how they might roll out in the next few months, and how they can go wrong.\n\nAnd then, it turns out there\u2019s a surprising muse for the new dump-on-Trump approach. He\u2019s a conservative who\u2019s written for The Atlantic: George Conway. He used to be married to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. And during his years of observing his ex-wife\u2019s boss, he gathered an arsenal of insights about how to make fun of Trump in a way that gets under his skin.\n\nAnd he tried them out before anyone else was doing it.\n\nGeorge Conway: The best way to hit the soft underbelly of his psychological disorders is to mock him. He cannot take mockery. It is the thing that makes him craziest, and the mockery diminishes him. It makes him look weak. And that\u2019s, you know, the reason why his followers follow him\u2014they think he is a strong man. And he is not.\n\nRosin: These days, Conway is looking prescient. But before we hear from him, I want to understand how Democrats are using this new strategy and what it might do for their chances in November.\n\nWith me to explain is staff writer David Graham. Hey, David.\n\nDavid Graham: Hello!\n\nRosin: Hi. So in 2016, as you know, Michelle Obama famously declared, \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d We all know that lately we\u2019re in a \u201cwe go low\u201d moment. And I have found it just fascinating to watch, just anthropologically, how this line coalesced and became so effective, in what seems to be, instantaneously.\n\nI\u2019m curious, as a political reporter, what you\u2019ve seen.\n\nGraham: I think, maybe, just going high kind of ran out of usefulness. I don\u2019t think it worked for a while. It didn\u2019t work in 2016 for Democrats. You know, they lost that election. But in 2020, you had Joe Biden going out with this kind of soul-of-America, Jon Meacham\u2013written speeches thing, which I think was a variation on that\u2014you know, very high-minded and lofty rhetoric and \u201cwe\u2019re going to save the soul of the nation\u201d stuff.\n\nAnd that worked. And then at some point, people got sick of it. It sort of lost its novelty. And, suddenly, you see Democrats ready to throw some punches, and that seems to be working for them now.\n\nRosin: Was it a spontaneous occurrence that just happened when the word weird came out of Tim Walz\u2019s mouth? Or do you get a sense it was more of an orchestrated campaign?\n\nGraham: I think there\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean, Walz clearly hit on something with weird. And it was interesting, even\u2014you could see him sort of developing it over a series of TV hits and recognizing that it was working and then being like, Oh, I\u2019m going to do that. Push that button more.\n\nBut I think even outside of that, kind of from the moment that Biden stepped down, you saw the nascent Harris campaign taking a little bit more aggressive approach and being less like, We\u2019re going to stand back. We\u2019re going to tell you about how important the stakes are, with a very deep voice, and more like, Yeah, let\u2019s bring it. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s mix this up.\n\nAnd so I think those things are all kind of connected and have coalesced to form a sort of go-low strategy, I guess.\n\nI mean, what blew me away\u2014and this sort of gets to the shift, I think\u2014is the back-to-back speeches by the Obamas at the DNC, because they have been so much the avatars of this. You know, it was Michelle Obama who used that phrase in the first place.\n\nYou know, they\u2019re very dignified. They try to sort of stay above the fray. And so Michelle comes in and gives one of the hotter political speeches I think I\u2019ve ever witnessed live and throws some punches in that one, talks about not expecting things to be given to us, sort of stuff.\n\nAnd then Barack Obama comes up after that and makes\u2014I\u2019m not even sure how I can refer to this\u2014makes an unsubtle joke about Trump\u2019s manhood.\n\nRosin: Yes. That was good. That was good. Good job there. \u201cManhood.\u201d I like it. Very 19th century. Yeah.\n\nGraham: And of all the people to say that\u2014Barack Obama. You know, he\u2019s a funny guy but, man, I almost couldn\u2019t believe it. So that\u2019s the one that sticks with me.\n\nRosin: You know what was astonishing to me about that moment? I did believe that, probably, when Michelle and Barack talk to each other, they talk like this, in the same way sort of people talk like this. It\u2019s not that you\u2019ve never heard Trump referenced or described in these ways.\n\nIt\u2019s just out loud in an official proceeding. It was the saying out loud of things that, you know, people normally just say to their friends. That\u2019s the breach that I was curious about. Like, how did everyone decide this is politically acceptable to say in public?\n\nGraham: Right. Right. Totally. Well, I think also there\u2019s\u2014Democrats, either intentionally or unintentionally, coupled the idea that democracy is important and there have to be guardrails and there have to be rules to the idea that also you can\u2019t say mean things.\n\nAnd I think what we\u2019re seeing from them now is you can actually decouple those things. You can talk about democracy being important. You can talk about guardrails. But it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t also ridicule Trump.\n\nRosin: Yes. And, in fact, I noticed that it was an order of operations\u2014that the mockery would come first, and then, But to be sure, we should take him seriously.\n\nGraham: Yeah. A Spoonful of Mockery Makes the Medicine Go Down, or whatever.\n\nRosin: Yeah, something like that. Now, I have been reading, I mean, at least back to 2020, maybe 2015\u2014there are often an op-ed or two, often from people who are either from other countries or have experience reporting in other countries that say, Mock the dictator. Like, Dictators are deflatable. In general, one thing I have learned from living slash reporting overseas is that dictators have big egos, and you just have to puncture them.\n\nAnd then they quote George Orwell, who\u2019ll say, \u201cEvery joke is a tiny revolution.\u201d And it does seem to be a strategy that\u2019s been out there and that nobody\u2019s plucked or used before.\n\nGraham: Yeah, I think part of that is it doesn\u2019t come naturally to the people who the Democrats have had atop their tickets.\n\nRosin: Mm-hmm.\n\nGraham: It\u2019s just not a Hillary Clinton thing, and it\u2019s not really a Joe Biden thing, either. And I think Harris just feels more naturally at home doing that.\n\nRosin: Do you have a theory about why weird worked? It\u2019s such a casual, nothing word.\n\nGraham: I mean, I think it\u2019s a couple things. One, J. D. Vance says some things that are pretty weird. I mean, I think it just resonates because it feels accurate, and it resonates because it was coming from Tim Walz, who feels so much like your high-school geography teacher. And so it feels like something he\u2014it doesn\u2019t feel calculated coming from him.\n\nIt feels really genuine and like he\u2019s the right messenger for that. Maybe that\u2019s it. I mean, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so simple. It seems like it ought to be\u2014it\u2019s hard for me to believe that just a single word this simple has permeated so quickly. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get over it quickly. But, like, even this much?\n\nRosin: But the way it permeated is fascinating because, in my mind, the word weird\u2014I do think of it like a series of literal dominoes. So you could have called J. D. Vance scary. Instead, they settled on weird, and weird is actually a way to reclaim the silent majority. Like, it is a flip.\n\nGraham: Mm-hmm.\n\nRosin: It\u2019s like: You\u2019re the weird ones. Like, We\u2019re the regular ones. We\u2019re the majority. And then the campaign kind of builds on top of that little word and reclaims freedom and then builds on top of that and reclaims patriotism. So this kind of dumb, nothing word becomes the cornerstone of an entire strategy of role reversals, you know?\n\nGraham: Yeah, and it\u2019s also tied to them\u2014you know, Harris sort of trying to run as an insurgent against an incumbent, even though she is the vice president, and he\u2019s not in office. All of these things tie together, totally.\n\nRosin: Right. There\u2019s just a flip. Okay, now I want to talk a little bit about the dangers of this strategy. You and I both work at The Atlantic magazine. I would argue that The Atlantic magazine has been very invested in taking Trump\u2019s threat to the future of our democracy very seriously. And so there is a way in which minimizing the threatening aspects of it makes it seem silly or like the person isn\u2019t really powerful, and it seems like there\u2019s some danger in that.\n\nGraham: Yes, I think that totally is right. But I do think there\u2019s a danger of minimization. And, like you were saying, you saw them sort of trying to do this, like, make the jokes and then kind of, But seriously, folks. This guy\u2019s going to tear down democracy. And it\u2019s tough to make those things go together. I also have questions about whether it really will be effective over an extended period of time. And I think about Republicans in the 2016 primary trying to ridicule Trump and use that against him, and mostly they all flopped.\n\nRosin: What do you mean? Can you give me an example?\n\nGraham: Oh, yeah. So Marco Rubio made another sort of suggestive, phallic remark talking about why Trump was so defensive about having small hands and got a response from Trump, but it didn\u2019t really work for Rubio. He ended up looking sort of like a middle-school kid trying to make a rude joke, and obviously he did not win the nomination.\n\nRosin: I think it\u2019s the many against the one. I\u2019ve thought about that too, because obviously this is not the first time anyone\u2019s, you know, used their hands and made the Obama joke. But it has to be everybody.\n\nIt\u2019s like that moment in the high-school movie when, at first, it\u2019s one kid against the other kid, and the bully always wins. But then, suddenly, the entire school comes up with the line, and then the entire school all of a sudden represents joy and goodness, and they\u2019re the ones singing on top of the desks, and the former bully is hiding under the desk. Like, it can\u2019t be one-on-one. And that\u2019s what\u2019s the sort of amazement of this moment, is how it coalesced and took form all at once.\n\nGraham: Well, I think Trump has lost something, too. He seems to have lost some of his speed. So you know, I think Axios had a story a week or two ago about his failure to come up with a nickname for Harris and listed all of the things that he\u2019s tried, and just none of them are taking. And it\u2019s hard for me to remember the last time he came up with a really good nickname, or at least a really catchy nickname.\n\nAnd so I think, maybe, Democrats sense some weakness and sense that he can be attacked in a way that he just can\u2019t defend as well as he once could. I also wonder if maybe he\u2019s just\u2014we\u2019re used to him. He\u2019s not as novel, and that takes some of the power out of him.\n\nRosin: Yeah, some of it is novelty. I mean, that\u2019s cheesily poetic, like an O. Henry story that the metaphor is his inability to come up\u2014like, the last one was \u201ccommunist Kamala.\u201d Like, his inability to come up with a nickname that sticks, that\u2019s the moment when he crumbles. So interesting.\n\nOkay. Back, though, to regular strategy. So here\u2019s another danger, just strategically, if you\u2019re running Kamala\u2019s campaign. If you\u2019re making fun of Trump, there\u2019s an implied audience to your message. Like, you are signaling, I am speaking to people who make fun of Trump. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the people that she needs to be speaking to right now. Those people are already with her.\n\nGraham: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think that if it works\u2014the kind of ridiculing strategy works because it actually reaches other people. I mean, the high-minded approach, I think, has reached all the people it can. If you think that democracy is under threat from Trump, you\u2019re probably already supporting Harris.\n\nSo that\u2019s kind of a base play at this point, in a weird way. But, you know, if you\u2019re not sure\u2014maybe you\u2019re one of these voters who voted for Trump once or twice but maybe not with a lot of enthusiasm, and then you were kind of appalled by January 6, but you also haven\u2019t loved the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nIf you make this guy seem small and weak and ridiculous, I think it can appeal to some of those people, in the same way that the schoolyard bully, by being undercut, suddenly loses his power over everyone. Like, once someone recognizes that he can be punctured, there\u2019s no one who can be bullied, because they\u2019ve seen that he just doesn\u2019t have the mojo anymore.\n\nRosin: So you\u2019re a political reporter who\u2019s been covering Trump for a very long time. What do you imagine he\u2019s saying and doing now? We\u2019ve had dribs and drabs from the campaign, but I wonder, where do you think he\u2019s at now?\n\nBecause we\u2019ve been talking about the strategy aimed at him. But I\u2019m curious\u2014and I know this is speculation\u2014how is it landing on him?\n\nGraham: Right. You know, he tends to rage whenever he\u2019s down. He gets really upset. And I think even in his public pronouncements, we can see a little bit of this. Like, threatening to pull out of the debate is a gesture of frustration with the way things are going, frustration with the coverage. And, you know, those things come and go, but I think the fact that those rumors are circulating is a sign of the kind of backbiting inside Trump headquarters that we remember well from previous campaigns but hadn\u2019t seen until now.\n\nRosin: This private raging and campaign chaos, it\u2019s not just a side effect of this kind of messaging. It\u2019s a strategy unto itself. And it\u2019s one that my next guest has spent years thinking about. George Conway\u2019s efforts to publicly mock Trump often get the result he\u2019s after.\n\nBut he\u2019s also well aware of the risks.\n\nConway: There\u2019s a double-edged sword. Like, you want people to take the danger seriously, but at the same time, you want to make clear that he\u2019s a fool.\n\nRosin: All that, after the break.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: George Conway is a well known conservative lawyer. During the Trump administration, he was considered for jobs in the Justice Department, and his then-wife, Kellyanne Conway, was, of course, Trump\u2019s very visible advisor.\n\nBut at some point, Conway started to sour on Trump while his wife was still working for the president. And then one week, in March 2019, Conway tweeted a few things about Trump\u2019s mental stability, including a picture of the official definition of narcissistic personality disorder. Trump, who you could argue had other things to do, tweeted back that Conway was a stone-cold loser, the husband from hell.\n\nConway: Which is like, Dude, why are you doing that? It\u2019s like, You should be ignoring me, right? Anybody in the White House would have told him, and I believe he was told, Ignore Conway.\n\nRosin: But he didn\u2019t. And Conway took Trump\u2019s inability to ignore him as proof that he was right because one of the hallmarks of narcissism is extreme sensitivity to criticism, an inability to ignore it.\n\nConway: Even if it\u2019s not constructive to respond to the criticism, even if it means that he\u2019s amplifying the criticism, and even if it means he is not talking about what he needs to be talking about, either as president or as a candidate\u2014\n\nRosin: That year, Conway wrote a story for The Atlantic that said Trump\u2019s narcissism made him unfit for the presidency. And he decided he would do something to help make sure he wasn\u2019t reelected. Conway had an idea\u2014a really specific, out-there idea, which came to him one day when he was listening to some strategists talk minutiae about which campaign ads to run in which markets.\n\nConway: It occurred to me that all you needed to do to drive the guy nuts was to run ads on the cable provider to the White House.\n\nAnd one day I was in my office at 52nd and 6th in New York, and my friend Molly Jong-Fast said, Hey, I\u2019m having lunch with Rick Wilson.\n\nAnd I said, Oh, can I join you? Because I wanted to meet Rick. I knew he was an ad guy. I knew he was an amazing troll of Trump, and he wrote a book about Trump. And so we had lunch. It was, like, three in the afternoon at Quality Meats on 6th Avenue. And I told him my idea.\n\nAnd he looks like his eyes lit up, because he understood immediately. And we started talking about the kinds of things you could run as audience\u2014you know, we didn\u2019t call it audience-of-one ads, but basically that\u2019s what we were talking about.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to run these ads all over the place. You don\u2019t have to run them in swing states. You could run ads that just drive him nuts by just, basically, running it in the White House.\n\nRosin: So he tried it out. It was surprisingly easy.\n\nConway: And what happened when we formed the Lincoln Project later is we took that idea, and we started running ads in Mar-a-Lago. It cost, like, $5,000 for just one spot on\u2014it was Tucker [Carlson] I think it was, or [Sean] Hannity\u2014just to run it in a very, very narrow place.\n\nRosin: That\u2019s amazing. And what were the ads?\n\nConway: The one ad that I remember he responded to was called \u201cMourning in America,\u201d M-O-U-R-N-I-N-G.\n\nAdvertisement: There\u2019s mourning in America. Today, more than 60,000 Americans have died from a deadly virus Donald Trump ignored.\n\nConway: The ad was a contrast to the \u201cMorning in America\u201d ads, the positive messages that Reagan did in 1984, except it was \u201cMourning in America.\u201d And it was like, How terrible. Everybody\u2019s out of work because of COVID, and Trump\u2019s an idiot.\n\nAnd Trump went out after watching that. I think he must have been watching it in the White House. It was on Fox News. And, like, the next day, he\u2019s at Andrews air base about to get on Air Force One, and he starts yapping about the Lincoln Project to the media, that they\u2019re calling us a bunch of losers.\n\nAnd then, you know, the next day, Lincoln Project has $4 million in contributions, or some figure like that. And it was like, that was the proof of concept.\n\nRosin: Conway has kept it up over the years. More recently, he started the Anti-Psychopath PAC, which runs these quick-cut, trolly kind of ads specifically about Trump\u2019s mental instability. There are a lot of mentions of Trump praising Hannibal Lecter, for example.\n\nThey, too, are targeted at an audience of one, and the aim is to elicit a very specific cascade of reactions.\n\nConway: Trump is somebody who could be manipulated. But you cannot control him, at the end of the day. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s just so important for people to keep hitting him with truthful descriptions of his behavior that conflict with his personal self-image, the image he wants to create.\n\nAnd it deeply wounds him. I mean, it deeply wounds him, to the point where he responds to it in a manner that, instead of talking about economics in his speech that he\u2019s supposed to be talking about economics, he\u2019s talking about who\u2019s weird and who\u2019s not weird, which is weird.\n\nRosin: All right. So you\u2019ve been doing this for a while. You\u2019ve, like, road tested the strategy that the Democrats are now using. Were you surprised, starting from the weird moment and then going through the Democratic convention, how suddenly mocking the president was politically acceptable on a stage by very dignified people?\n\nConway: Yes and no. I mean, I think they finally get it, the Democrats.\n\nThe way you win this election, I thought, is Trump has to become the issue. And once Biden stepped aside, Trump became the issue because he was the old guy in the race. And the Democrats had a fresh face, and all of a sudden people were looking more at Trump.\n\nYou know, I\u2019d like to think I had something to do with encouraging all of this, but I think they figured it out, and one way or the other. But it\u2019s something. I mean, I\u2019ve been banging the drums on this for years, and it\u2019s sort of gratifying to see it finally happen.\n\nI mean, in 2020, I was tweeting that the Democrats should hire a team of psychological professionals to advise them how to get under Trump\u2019s skin. They didn\u2019t do it then. They don\u2019t have to do it now. You don\u2019t really need shrinks to do this. You just need to, basically, you know, make fun of the guy.\n\nAnd he gives you thousands of things to make fun of, from Hannibal Lecter to sharks to electrocution to injecting bleach. You know, the guy is endlessly\u2014I mean, he\u2019s absurd. And pointing that out, you have to do it in a way that reminds people, though: He\u2019s dangerous.\n\nRosin: Yeah, that\u2019s the subtext.\n\nConway: Right.\n\nRosin: So the text is kind of a joke, mocking, trolling. The subtext is: He\u2019s dangerous. Got it.\n\nConway: Right. But it reminds me of this\u2014there\u2019s this Star Trek episode where the Enterprise is kind of held hostage by some incorporeal being, if that\u2019s the right word, that was basically causing, through its telepathy or whatever, the crew of the Enterprise to engage in conflict with one another, literally fighting each other in hallways in the various decks of the starship.\n\nStar Trek episode: The rest of our lives, a thousand lifetimes, senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us.\n\nConway: And Kirk and Spock, or one of them, realizes that the way to defeat this evil being was to start laughing at it.\n\nStar Trek episode: Cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain. I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.\n\nConway: And they started laughing at it, and all of a sudden, the being shriveled away back into space. And that\u2019s kind of like the way Trump works.\n\nRosin: Yeah. That\u2019s really good.\n\nStar Trek episode: Out! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!\n\nRosin: Well, thank you so much for walking us through that. That was really interesting. I feel like you\u2019re a prototype for what we\u2019re now seeing on a big stage. So it\u2019s just interesting to hear about your experience.\n\nConway: Thanks for having me.\n\nRosin: This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid. It was engineered by Rob Smierciak and fact-checked by Sam Fentress. Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor. I\u2019m Hanna Rosin.

            "headline": "Kamala Harris should stand with tech workers, not their bosses",
            "text": "Will either candidate keep pushing forward for labor? The answer is not so clear. Monied tech interests are lining up on both sides to advocate for looser regulation. While pro-Trump venture capitalists Andreessen and Ben Horowitz cited euphemistic \u201cbad government policies\u201d as the number one threat to the tech industry, the Silicon Valley powers that be on Harris\u2019s side haven\u2019t exactly come out swinging for labor. In fact, Hoffman said that the FTC\u2019s Khan is \u201cwaging war on American business\u201d and urged Harris to fire her.\n\nIt\u2019s not evident yet if Harris shares the views of her billionaire supporters, but she\u2019s certainly chasing their money. A recent Harris campaign fundraiser in San Francisco bagged $13 million from a guest list replete with tech executives. And the vice president is reportedly courting tech bosses more directly, sending aides to meet with crypto leaders and venture capital firms. Her ties to the industry are long-standing and often personal; she\u2019s known to be close with both former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Laurene Powell Jobs, and her brother-in-law is Uber\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\nWhile Harris\u2019s team has been having conversations and exploring options, it has not yet announced any economic agenda or approach to regulation, innovation, or labor. It\u2019s savvy to get the money first without making public promises. But Harris should be trying to court our votes, too\u2014not just our bosses\u2019 financial support. In recent memory, workers in the tech industry have demonstrated progressive energy. While campaigning in 2020, Bernie Sanders proudly voiced solidarity with workers against their billionaire bosses. And tech workers turned out for him, donating more to Bernie than to any other presidential candidate during the primaries\u2014close to twice as much as to Elizabeth Warren, the second-favorite candidate for the group. Harris could leverage that kind of power in November if she truly commits to the cause.\n\nNow is the moment for Harris to step up and make a statement in support of workers, promising to continue, if not expand upon, the Biden-Harris approach to Big Tech. Some may remember that when she ran for president in 2020, Senator Harris sided with Uber drivers and against her brother-in-law\u2019s interests during a fight about gig workers\u2019 rights in California. Unions like ours\u2014as well as any American who believes that fair labor practices are essential to a functioning democracy\u2014can continue to apply pressure on Harris and her team to take a strong stand for worker rights and protections. Indeed, the United Auto Workers (UAW) filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk after those careless comments at the Spaces event, whereas President Biden walked a picket line with striking auto workers. Voices like theirs and ours\u2014the voices of the hundreds of thousands of workers we represent\u2014will continue to be raised. If we aren\u2019t heard, we will get louder.\n\nThe stakes in November are high, and the only truly democratic future is one with fair wages, worker protections, and shared abundance. Tech elites stand in united opposition to such a future and are actively developing the AI tools to undermine it. Tech workers will continue to expand our collective power to fight those elites. The only open question is whether the next administration will be on our side or theirs.\n\nStephen McMurtry is a Google Software Engineer and Communications Chair of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA"

Alternativ sollten Versicherungen gezwungen werden, f\u00fcr die Behandlung aufzukommen. 23:21 Uhr \u2013 Ein Republikaner soll in Harris Kabinett Die demokratische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris k\u00fcndigt in ihrem ersten TV-Interview seit ihrer Nominierung an, bei einem Wahlsieg einen Republikaner in ihr Kabinett holen zu wollen. \u201eIch habe noch 68 Tage bis zur Wahl, also will ich das Pferd nicht von hinten aufz\u00e4umen\u201c, sagte die 59-J\u00e4hrige in dem Interview. Sie sei aber \u00fcberzeugt, dass es wichtig sei, dass bei den bedeutendsten Entscheidungen Leute mit am Tisch sitzen m\u00fcssten, die andere Ansichten und andere Erfahrungen h\u00e4tten, sagte Harris. \u201eUnd ich denke, dass es f\u00fcr die amerikanische \u00d6ffentlichkeit von Vorteil w\u00e4re, ein Mitglied meines Kabinetts zu haben, das Republikaner ist.\u201c 22:57 Uhr \u2013 Kennedys Name bleibt auf Stimmzetteln Trotz seines R\u00fcckzugs aus dem US-Wahlkampf und seiner Unterst\u00fctzungserkl\u00e4rung f\u00fcr den Republikaner Donald Trump wird Robert F. Kennedy bei der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl am 5. November im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat North Carolina auf den Stimmzetteln stehen. Die dortige Wahlaufsicht lehnte am Donnerstag einen Antrag seiner Partei We The People ab, Kennedys Namen von den Stimmzetteln zu streichen. Daf\u00fcr sei es jetzt zu sp\u00e4t. 22:44 Uhr \u2013 Milit\u00e4r verst\u00e4rkt Hilfe f\u00fcr Secret Service Das US-Milit\u00e4r will den Secret Service bei der Sicherung von Wahlkampfveranstaltungen in den USA st\u00e4rker unterst\u00fctzen. US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin habe einem entsprechenden Hilfeersuchen des Heimatschutzministeriums zugestimmt, teilte Pentagon-Sprecherin Sabrina Singh mit. Austin habe den Befehlshaber des n\u00f6rdlichen US-Kommandos angewiesen, die Unterst\u00fctzung des f\u00fcr den Schutz der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten und ihre Stellvertreter zust\u00e4ndigen Secret Service zu verst\u00e4rken. Dies gelte auch f\u00fcr den gew\u00e4hlten Pr\u00e4sidenten und seinen Stellvertreter nach der Wahl am 5. November bis zur Amtseinf\u00fchrung im Januar 2025. 22:06 Uhr \u2013 Vance von Feuerwehrleuten ausgebuht J.D.Vance ist bei einem Auftritt bei der Tagung Feuerwehrgewerkschaft ausgebuht worden. Die Buhrufe im Publikum ert\u00f6nten gleich zu Beginn des Auftritts des Senatos, andere Zuschauer applaudierten allerdings auch. \u201eKlingt so, als h\u00e4tten wir einige Fans und einige Hasser\u201c, sagte der 40-J\u00e4hrige bei der Konferenz in der Ostk\u00fcsten-Metropole Boston. \u201eDas ist in Ordnung. H\u00f6ren Sie sich an, was ich zu sagen habe, und ich werde meinen Standpunkt darlegen\u201c, so Vance weiter. 15:21 Uhr \u2013 Plattenfirma verbietet Trump, Abba-Songs auf Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu spielen\n\n\u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre Karrieren ausgewirkt haben\u201c, sagt Trump \u00fcber Clinton und Harris Die US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin der Demokraten, Kamala Harris, gibt zusammen mit Vizekandidat Tim Walz ihr erstes TV-Interview. Unterdessen geht Donald Trump einmal mehr unter die G\u00fcrtellinie. Erik Kirschbaum fasst die Ereignisse zusammen.\n\nDie Plattenfirma von ABBA fordert den US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Donald Trump auf, die zahlreichen Hits der schwedischen Kultband nicht mehr bei seinen Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu verwenden. Universal Music in Schweden teilte der Nachrichtenagentur AFP in einer E-Mail mit, auf Videos sei zu sehen, dass die Musik von ABBA bei mindestens einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung des Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten gespielt worden sei. \u201eWir haben verlangt, dass es heruntergenommen und entfernt wird\u201c, hie\u00df es \u00fcber das Material. Die Plattenfirma hob hervor, dass sie nicht um Erlaubnis f\u00fcr die Nutzung der ABBA-Songs gebeten worden sei. Daher habe Trump auch \u201ekeine Erlaubnis oder Lizenz\u201c daf\u00fcr.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel 50 Jahre \u201eWaterloo\u201c Abba \u2013 das Geheimnis der fantastischsten Vier\n\nVor der schwedischen Kultband hatten schon einige andere K\u00fcnstler Trump untersagt, ihre Musik zu verwenden, darunter Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Celine Dion und die Rolling Stones. 14:34 Uhr \u2013 Harris punktet bei Frauen und Hispanics \u2013 Vorsprung vor Trump w\u00e4chst Harris hat einer Reuters/Ipsos-Umfrage zufolge ihren Vorsprung zu Trump ausgebaut. Sie f\u00fchrt laut der am Donnerstag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Umfrage mit einer Zustimmung von 45 Prozent vor Trump mit 41 Prozent. Die Erhebung wurde in den vergangenen acht Tagen bis Mittwoch vorgenommen. In einer Umfrage von Reuters/Ipsos von Ende Juli hatte Harris bei registrierten W\u00e4hlern mit nur einem Prozentpunkt vor Trump gelegen. Die neue Umfrage hat eine Fehlerquote von zwei Prozent. In wichtigen Swing States hat Trump aber die Nase vorn.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl Welche globalen Trends f\u00fcr einen Sieg von Trump sprechen \u2013 und welche f\u00fcr Harris\n\nBei Frauen und hispanischen W\u00e4hlern lag Harris laut der Umfrage deutlich vor Trump \u2013 hier f\u00fchrte sie den Daten zufolge mit 49 zu 36 Prozent. Damit legte sie im Vergleich zur letzten Erhebung im Juli bei beiden Gruppen weiter zu. Trump lag dagegen bei wei\u00dfen W\u00e4hlern und M\u00e4nnern unver\u00e4ndert vorn. Es sei offensichtlich, dass das Rennen gegen Harris f\u00fcr Trump eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung sei als der Wahlkampf gegen Biden, sagte der republikanische Wahlkampf-Experte Matt Wolking. Doch sei Harris f\u00fcr Trump \u201enicht un\u00fcberwindlich\u201c. Trump m\u00fcsse vor allem darauf achten, W\u00e4hler nun nicht zu verschrecken, die in der Vergangenheit zu ihm tendierten, weil sie Biden ablehnten. 14:00 Uhr \u2013 Pressesprecher von J.D. Vance soll Verbindungen zu Rechtsextremen haben Parker Magid, der neue Pressesprecher des republikanischen Vizekandidaten J.D. Vance, hat f\u00fcr eine Beraterfirma gearbeitet, die tief verflochten mit neurechten und rechtsextremen Think-Tanks sein soll. Das berichtet der \u201eGuadrian\u201c Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet . So soll die Beraterfirma Beck & Stone fundamentale Christen unterst\u00fctzen und der \u201eSociety for American Civic Renewal\u201c nahestehen, einer Geheimloge der Far-Right-Bewegung. Einer Extremismusforscherin zufolge, die der \u201eGuardian\u201c zitiert, handelt es sich bei den mit der Beraterfirma verwobenen Organisationen um solche, die in ihren Ansichten \u00fcber den konventionellen Konservatismus weit hinausgehen. 10:23 Uhr \u2013 Fotos von deutscher Influencerin von Pro-Trump-Accounts benutzt Pro-Trump-Accounts im Online-Dienst X bedienen sich bei Social-Media-Fotos von 17 europ\u00e4ischen Frauen. Das berichtet der US-Sender CNN. Auch mindestens eine Deutsche sei betroffen. Dies habe eine Untersuchung in Kooperation mit dem Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) ergeben. Die benutzten Fotos seien auf X-Profilen ausgespielt worden, die offenbar Teil einer koordinierten Kampagne waren, welche das Trump-Vance-Lager vor den Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen unterst\u00fctzen sollte. Laut CNN-Bericht zeigt eine Analyse dutzender Pro-Trump-Konten ein systematisches Muster von \u201enicht authentischem Verhalten\u201c. Alle Konten w\u00fcrden gestohlene oder manipulierte Fotos von jungen Frauen zeigen, die ihre Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Trump in Posts erkl\u00e4rten und Hashtags wie #MAGAPatriots oder #MAGA2024 verwendeten. Die Bilder seien oftmals manipuliert worden, um auf der Kleidung Trump-Slogans zu platzieren. Es gebe keinen Hinweis darauf, dass Trump und sein Team involviert waren.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl 2024 Dumm vs. d\u00fcmmer \u2013 Harris und Trump \u00fcberbieten sich mit \u00f6konomischer Ahnungslosigkeit\n\nEiner der Fake-Accounts, der im CNN-Artikel genannt wird, hei\u00dft @Luna_2K24.

M\u00f6glicherweise illegales Verhalten k\u00f6nnte in einem Verfahren ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. 04:26 Uhr \u2013 Trump provoziert mit vulg\u00e4rem Kommentar zu Harris Donald Trump provoziert mit der Verbreitung einer vulg\u00e4ren Bemerkung \u00fcber seine demokratische Kontrahentin Kamala Harris. Trump teilte auf der von ihm mit begr\u00fcndeten Plattform Truth Social den Beitrag eines anderen Nutzers, der andeutete, dass sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten Harris\u2018 politische Karriere bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten. In dem Post ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Kamala Harris zu sehen an der Seite der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton, die 2016 im Wahlkampf gegen Trump angetreten war. Dazu der Kommentar: \u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben...\u201c\n\nDie derbe Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sex-Skandal, in den Clintons Mann Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 \u2013 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Trump-Unterst\u00fctzer wiederum verbreiten v\u00f6llig unbelegte Behauptungen \u00fcber Harris, wonach die romantische Beziehung zu einem einflussreichen Politiker in Kalifornien in den 90er Jahren ihrer Karriere geholfen habe. 00:11 Uhr \u2013 Trump-Team \u00e4u\u00dfert sich zu Vorfall auf Soldatenfriedhof Donald Trump hatte am Montag auf dem Friedhof nahe der US-Hauptstadt Washington bei einer Kranzniederlegung der vor drei Jahren bei einem Selbstmordanschlag in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten US-Soldaten gedacht. Auch einige Familienmitglieder der Opfer waren anwesend. Nun wurde bekannt, dass es bei der Visite zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen Trumps Team und Mitarbeitern des Friedhofs kam. Kritiker warfen dem republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Trump vor, er habe seinen Besuch f\u00fcr Wahlkampfzwecke missbraucht. Seine Kampagne wies das zur\u00fcck. Die US-Rundfunkorganisation NPR berichtete, zwei Trump-Mitarbeiter h\u00e4tten bei dem Besuch einen Mitarbeiter des Friedhofs beschimpft und zur Seite geschubst, als dieser Film- und Fotoaufnahmen auf einem bestimmten Teil des Gel\u00e4ndes habe unterbinden wollen. Ein Trump-Sprecher schreibt nun auf der Plattform X, ein Fotograf sei zugelassen gewesen. In einer Stellungnahme f\u00fcr NPR erkl\u00e4rte dieser weiter, der Friedhofsmitarbeiter habe wohl \u201ean einer psychischen St\u00f6rung\u201c gelitten und sich Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams physisch in den Weg gestellt.\n\nTrumps Wahlkampfteam ver\u00f6ffentlichte auf X au\u00dferdem eine Stellungnahme von Angeh\u00f6rigen der in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten Soldaten, die dem Republikaner f\u00fcr seinen Besuch dankten. Sie h\u00e4tten der Teilnahme eines Fotografen zugestimmt, und das Verhalten von Trump und dessen Team sei von gr\u00f6\u00dftem Respekt gepr\u00e4gt gewesen. Mittwoch, 28. August 21:21 Uhr \u2013 Motiv des Trump-Attent\u00e4ters wirft weiter Fragen auf Nach dem Attentat auf Donald Trump k\u00f6nnen die Ermittler noch immer keine eindeutige Aussage zum Motiv des Sch\u00fctzen treffen. Der Mann habe im Internet nach Veranstaltungen sowohl mit Trump als auch mit Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden gesucht, berichteten unter anderem die Sender NBC News und MSNBC unter Berufung auf hochrangige FBI-Beamte. Bei der Trump-Kundgebung habe es sich vermutlich um ein \u201eGelegenheitsziel\u201c gehandelt. Die Ermittler h\u00e4tten eine \u201eMischung an Ideologien\u201c ausmachen k\u00f6nnen, berichtete NBC News weiter. \u201eIch w\u00fcrde sagen, dass wir keine eindeutige Ideologie in Verbindung mit unserer Zielperson sehen, weder links- noch rechtsorientiert\u201c, zitierte das Medium einen Beamten. Man sei noch dabei, alle Spuren auszuwerten und Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen. 07:07 Uhr \u2013 Trump einigt sich mit \u201efiesestem\u201c Nachrichtensender Donald Trump verk\u00fcndet eine Einigung im Streit um das TV-Duell am 10. September mit Kamala Harris beim Nachrichtensender ABC. Bei der TV-Debatte sollen die gleichen Regeln wie beim CNN-Duell im Juni, damals noch mit Joe Biden, gelten, teilte Trump mit. Damals gab es kein Studiopublikum \u2013 und die Mikrofone waren stummgeschaltet, wenn der politische Gegner sprach. Letzteres war der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Streitpunkt und ein Wunsch von Trump. Der Republikaner bezeichnete ABC als den \u201emit Abstand fiesesten und unfairsten\u201c Nachrichtensender der Branche.

            "headline": "The History Behind Attacks on the Military Records of Politicians Like Tim Walz",
            "text": "Since Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, some Trump supporters, including Republican military veterans in Congress, have attacked his service record, accusing him of inflating his rank and avoiding combat.\n\nThese charges reflect a sordid pattern that has developed over the past two decades in which Republicans have tried to turn military service \u2014 which historically has been a strength for candidates \u2014 into a weakness, particularly for Vietnam veterans but now extending to those who fought in the Global War on Terror.\n\nThese tactics have proved successful for winning competitive elections by calling into question the character and national security bona fides of Democrats with military records. But the cost has been high, both to those attacked and their fellow veterans as well.\n\nThis process largely began in 2002 when Republican operatives began questioning the patriotism of Vietnam veteran and triple amputee Georgia Senator Max Cleland during his reelection campaign. Cleland joined the Army after college, eventually deploying to Vietnam. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Khe Sanh on June 9, 1968, winning a Silver Star \u201cfor gallantry in action.\u201d\n\nFour days later, he volunteered for a mission. As he moved across a helicopter landing pad, he reached down to pick up a grenade that he thought fell from his gear. However, a new infantryman had dropped it and not properly prepared the grenade pin. The subsequent explosion blew off both legs and an arm.\n\nFor years, Cleland fought to overcome his maiming. Even while leaving Vietnam on a stretcher, he lamented: \u201cone minute I would be utterly grateful that I was still able to see, breathe, feel and think. The next minute I would sink into despair knowing that I would never again be the man I was once was.\u201d\n\nDuring months of rehab, Cleland battled depression, while learning how to do things with his remaining arm. He learned to walk on prosthetic legs, drive a special car, and even play basketball, noting \u201cI was getting strong in the right places.\u201d As he recovered, he noted how politics became \u201cmy therapy, forcing me to get out of the house and be seen.\u201d\n\nThrough sheer determination, Cleland won a seat in the Georgia Senate (1971-1975) and then followed his fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter to Washington where he became a high-ranking administrator in what was then called the Veteran\u2019s Administration. He ultimately returned home and became Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State, a position he held for 14 years (1982-1996).\n\nRead More: What The Swifties Cost Us\n\nIn 1996, Cleland succeeded his mentor Sam Nunn in the U.S. Senate. After he won, he became a vocal advocate for veterans and the environment. Journalist David Broder stressed how Cleland \u201cembodies as much as any one person in public life can, the agonies and hopes of the last twenty years.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Republicans recruited Representative Saxby Chambliss \u2014 who had not served in Vietnam \u2014 to challenge Cleland. Chambliss proved to be a relatively lackluster candidate and through much of the race he trailed Cleland. But with control of the Senate potentially at stake, operative Rick Wilson labored to help Chambliss stage a comeback.\n\nWilson unleashed one of the most infamous attacks in the history of U.S. political campaigns. The strategist later said that \u201ceveryone assumed Cleland was immune to critiques on national security issues,\u201d but that perception didn\u2019t account for just how dirty Wilson was willing to fight. As he admitted, \u201cI have no moral center when it comes to political ads, and I will destroy the innocent and the guilty.\u201d\n\nWilson created an ad that emphasized how Cleland had voted against 11 amendments to President Bush\u2019s plan to create a Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The television spot showed photos of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, and implied Cleland had aided them with his lack of \u201ccourage to lead.\u201d In reality, he voted against the amendments because he wanted civil service protections for DHS employees.\n\nThe ad unleashed a firestorm of criticism. Cleland called it \u201cthe most vicious exploitation of a national tragedy and attempt at character assassination I have ever witnessed.\u201d The Gainesville Times (Ga.) called it \u201can irresponsible and repugnant attack on Cleland\u2019s character and sense of patriotism.\u201d Vietnam veteran Republican Senators John McCain and Chuck Hagel rallied to Cleland\u2019s defense and praised his patriotism. The former said the ad was \u201cworse than disgraceful, it\u2019s reprehensible.\u201d Chambliss pulled the spot, although he always defended it, calling it \u201clightweight\u201d and \u201cvery fair.\u201d\n\nIn the fear-drenched post 9/11 climate, however, the damage to Cleland had been done. The ad succeeded in questioning his commitment to the nation, particularly in the many parts of Georgia that unswervingly supported President George W. Bush and his War on Terrorism. Cleland lost by 130,000 votes, helping to flip the Senate. It was a devastating defeat that left Cleland bitter, disillusioned, and suffering from PTSD.\n\nThe attacks on Cleland\u2019s patriotism and military record didn\u2019t stop there either. In 2004, he strongly supported fellow Vietnam veteran, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, in his presidential campaign against Bush. The former senator openly questioned how Bush secured a prized position in the Air National Guard and whether he actually did his service. He also highlighted how Bush took time off to earn a Harvard MBA while he and Kerry went to Vietnam.\n\nConservatives pounced. Pundit Ann Coulter stressed that Cleland \u201clost three limbs in an accident during a routine non-combat mission where he was about to drink beer with friends . . . Luckily for Cleland\u2019s political career . . . he happened to do it while in Vietnam.\u201d She even questioned his Silver Star, ignoring that his actions happened before the horrible accident.\n\nOthers piled on in an effort to undercut Cleland\u2019s support for Kerry. And it wasn\u2019t just Cleland whose service the right besmirched.\n\nRead More: Watch and Read Tim Walz\u2019s Full Speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention\n\nThe group Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth (SBVT) called Kerry\u2019s service into question, aiming to negate his heroism in Vietnam where he won a Silver Star and Purple Hearts. They learned from Wilson\u2019s success and tried to turn Kerry\u2019s strength into a weakness. Much like in Georgia, it proved successful.\n\nThe attacks on Cleland and Kerry (and, a decade later, on McCain by President Donald Trump) contributed to the psychological trauma of many who fought in Vietnam by questioning their awards and military service. As one Florida veteran noted after the SBVT attacks: \u201cDo you think these awards come in a Cracker Jack box? The Department of Defense issues them with great scrutiny.\u201d He concluded: \u201cSeriously folks, this type of slander diminishes each and every veteran and their awards, and it needs to stop, NOW.\u201d\n\nBy questioning awards given to Democrats, such scurrilous tactics undermined confidence in the system that determined awards for all Vietnam soldiers. It further hurt the process of healing and reinforced the poor treatment afforded Vietnam veterans, this time in the political realm by those claiming to support service people.\n\nToday, conservatives have reverted to this old playbook to cast aspersion on Walz\u2019s 24-year National Guard career. Not surprisingly \u2014 in a parallel to the Swift Boat Veterans campaign \u2014 it is led by Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance, who served four years in the Marines as a public affairs officer. Also, it's also no surprise that Chris LaCivita, who produced the SVBT ads, is a senior Trump campaign official.\n\nIn the effort to tar Walz, conservatives have employed terms such as \"stolen valor\" and cowardice to describe his military career. At this point, the attacks appear to have had little measurable effect on Walz\u2019s popularity. However, it can take time for such lies to have an impact.\n\nRepublicans continue to attack the service of Democratic military veterans (and sometimes their own, like McCain and former Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger) because it has so much political effect. It can turn a major positive into a negative.\n\nBut the cost to American veterans has been significant. It\u2019s time that those pushing such charges get confronted with the immortal question that Army Chief Counsel Joseph Welch used to trigger the downfall of Senator Joseph McCarthy after he attacked the Army in 1954: \u201cHave you no sense of decency?\u201d\n\nKyle Longley is the Salvatori chair of history at Chapman University and author of the forthcoming (in 2025), The Forever Soldiers: Americans at War in Afghanistan and Iraq and Grunts: The American Combat Soldier in Vietnam.\n\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and edited by professional historians.

            "headline": "AN\u00c1LISIS | La entrevista de Harris con CNN es el \u00faltimo y muy esperado giro en la desenfrenada carrera presidencial",
            "text": "As\u00ed van las campa\u00f1as presidenciales en EE.UU. 5:58\n\n(CNN) -- La vicepresidenta Kamala Harris se enfrenta este jueves a la siguiente prueba en su carrera presidencial con su primera entrevista sin guion con un importante medio de comunicaci\u00f3n desde que se convirti\u00f3 en la candidata dem\u00f3crata.\n\nHarris aspira a extender el impulso que ha conjurado en el inicio de su campa\u00f1a; y evitar los tipos de errores no forzados que plagaron su primera candidatura presidencial en 2019, as\u00ed como sus primeros d\u00edas como vicepresidenta. Tambi\u00e9n es una oportunidad para que la reci\u00e9n nombrada candidata acent\u00fae el contraste con el republicano Donald Trump, conecte con los votantes indecisos y destaque sus credenciales para liderar el Despacho Oval en un momento tenso para Estados Unidos dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds.\n\nHarris aparecer\u00e1 junto a su candidato a la vicepresidencia, Tim Walz, en un programa especial en horario de m\u00e1xima audiencia de CNN que se emitir\u00e1 a las 9 pm hora del este de Estados Unidos, desde Georgia, donde se encuentra en una gira en autob\u00fas dise\u00f1ada para volver a poner en el tablero un estado indeciso que el Partido Republicano pensaba que estaba cerca de asegurar en noviembre. La entrevista es el cap\u00edtulo m\u00e1s importante de la campa\u00f1a entre la convenci\u00f3n dem\u00f3crata de la semana pasada en Chicago y el debate presidencial previsto en Filadelfia el 10 de septiembre.\n\nLa entrevista, con Dana Bash, adquiri\u00f3 una gran importancia debido a la comprimida carrera que Harris est\u00e1 llevando a cabo tras convertirse en la candidata de su partido y por la forma en que se ha convertido en un problema entre las enemistadas campa\u00f1as. Es el \u00faltimo momento de gran expectativa en una carrera desenfrenada en la que Trump se convirti\u00f3 en el primer candidato de un partido importante que fue condenado por un delito y, el expresidente sobrevivi\u00f3 a un intento de asesinato. Por su parte, la desastrosa actuaci\u00f3n del presidente Joe Biden en el debate de CNN en Atlanta desencaden\u00f3 una crisis que acab\u00f3 con su candidatura a la reelecci\u00f3n.\n\nLas grandes entrevistas televisivas, como la de este jueves, tambi\u00e9n desempe\u00f1aron un papel desproporcionado: el presidente acept\u00f3 varias en un intento de frenar su ca\u00edda, pero solo exacerbaron las preocupaciones sobre su edad y su capacidad para cumplir un segundo mandato completo.\n\npublicidad\n\nAl no programar una entrevista importante antes de ahora, Harris se expuso a las quejas de Trump y de algunos observadores no partidistas de que est\u00e1 tratando de eludir el escrutinio. Esto aumenta las posibilidades de que cualquier metedura de pata sea aprovechada por la campa\u00f1a de Trump. Sin embargo, una buena actuaci\u00f3n de la vicepresidenta supondr\u00eda otro reto para Trump, que ha pasado apuros desde que Harris transform\u00f3 la carrera al reducir su ventaja en los campos de batalla electorales y recaudar US$ 500 millones.\n\nTrump, Harris y la controversia para el pr\u00f3ximo debate 6:34\n\nA\u00f1adir sustancia a un alegre despliegue\n\nAunque Harris despert\u00f3 un intenso entusiasmo en la Convenci\u00f3n Nacional Dem\u00f3crata de Chicago la semana pasada, repleta de estrellas, as\u00ed como en alegres reuniones entre dem\u00f3cratas que antes estaban desmoralizados por las posibilidades de reelecci\u00f3n de Biden, a\u00fan tiene que entrar en un foro en el que sus respuestas y pol\u00edticas puedan ser rebatidas. Sus discursos han estado repletos de lo que quiere hacer como presidenta: desde aliviar la carga econ\u00f3mica de los estadounidenses hasta desencadenar un auge de la construcci\u00f3n de viviendas o ganar la contienda geopol\u00edtica del siglo XXI contra China. Pero la vicepresidenta no ha concretado exactamente c\u00f3mo llevar\u00eda a la pr\u00e1ctica algunas de esas aspiraciones ni c\u00f3mo las financiar\u00eda en un Washington profundamente dividido.\n\nEn la entrevista se ver\u00e1 si Harris se distancia en temas clave con Biden, ya que se presenta como una candidata del cambio a pesar de haber sido vicepresidenta en una administraci\u00f3n impopular. Harris ya ha ido m\u00e1s lejos que su jefe al comprometerse a combatir los elevados precios de los alimentos que afectan a millones de estadounidenses. Este giro populista puede ser pol\u00edticamente inteligente, pero fue criticado por muchos economistas.\n\nLa entrevista se ha convertido en un obst\u00e1culo para la vicepresidenta porque los asesores de Trump llevan semanas incit\u00e1ndola, aparentemente convencidos de que no responder\u00e1 a las preguntas dif\u00edciles, de que se quedar\u00e1 en blanco en los detalles pol\u00edticos y de que carece de instintos pol\u00edticos \u00e1giles. En un comunicado este mi\u00e9rcoles, la campa\u00f1a de Trump se burl\u00f3 de Harris, diciendo que ella hab\u00eda \"reunido el coraje para sentarse para una 'entrevista conjunta' despu\u00e9s de 39 d\u00edas de esconderse de los periodistas\". Aunque no se ha sentado para una entrevista importante, Harris ha respondido a algunas preguntas de periodistas que viajaban con ella.\n\nTras a\u00f1os como fiscal general de California y senadora que destac\u00f3 en audiencias de alto nivel, Harris ha parecido a menudo m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda haciendo preguntas penetrantes que respondiendo a ellas. Carece de las d\u00e9cadas de experiencia pol\u00edtica que ayudaron a la excandidata dem\u00f3crata Hillary Clinton, por ejemplo, a convertir las entrevistas en seminarios pol\u00edticos. Y a diferencia de Trump, no inunda a los entrevistadores con torrentes de falsedades, declaraciones escandalosas y grandilocuencia, lo que significa que \u00e9l a menudo es capaz de distraer la atenci\u00f3n de lo que realmente dice.\n\nLos republicanos est\u00e1n convencidos de que Harris quedar\u00e1 en evidencia en situaciones de alta presi\u00f3n\n\nLa confianza de los republicanos en que Harris pueda quedar en evidencia en una entrevista televisada tiene su origen en un cara a cara que mantuvo con Lester Holt, de NBC, al principio de su vicepresidencia, y que se centr\u00f3 en su papel como como emisaria ante las naciones latinoamericanas que representan la fuente de gran parte de la migraci\u00f3n indocumentada a Estados Unidos.\n\nCuando se le pregunt\u00f3 por qu\u00e9 no hab\u00eda visitado la frontera sur como vicepresidenta, Harris se\u00f1al\u00f3 que tampoco hab\u00eda visitado Europa desde que asumi\u00f3 el cargo. Su incomodidad dio lugar a a\u00f1os de ataques republicanos y la entrevista sigue pesando sobre su mandato como vicepresidenta. En aquella entrevista, Harris parec\u00eda mal preparada, una situaci\u00f3n que parece poco probable que se repita teniendo en cuenta que est\u00e1 inmersa en los preparativos del debate. En entrevistas m\u00e1s recientes, por ejemplo, en el programa \"60 Minutes\" de CBS el pasado octubre y con Anderson Cooper de CNN a finales de junio, cuando defendi\u00f3 a Biden, parec\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s tranquila.\n\nDe cara a la entrevista de este jueves, los republicanos tambi\u00e9n exigen respuestas sobre por qu\u00e9 Harris ha abandonado algunas posiciones que mantuvo en su ef\u00edmera candidatura presidencial de 2020, incluyendo \"Medicare para todos\". Su campa\u00f1a tambi\u00e9n ha indicado que ya no se opone al fracking, un tema importante en Pensilvania, donde Trump est\u00e1 destacando la industria energ\u00e9tica de carbono de la mancomunidad.\n\nLa campa\u00f1a de Trump y los medios conservadores retrataron este mi\u00e9rcoles la presencia en la entrevista de Walz, el gobernador de Minnesota, como una muleta para la vicepresidenta. Sin embargo, no es inusual que los candidatos presidenciales aparezcan con sus vicepresidentes. Trump se sent\u00f3 con su candidato a vicepresidente, el senador de Ohio, J.D. Vance, en una entrevista amistosa en Fox News el mes pasado que termin\u00f3 con un segmento de \"preguntas de los fans\". El expresidente tambi\u00e9n hizo una entrevista conjunta con el nombrado candidato a la vicepresidencia, Mike Pence, en su \u00e1tico de la Torre Trump en el programa \"60 Minutes\" en 2016. El futuro vicepresidente trat\u00f3 de matizar las posturas extremas del hombre que lo eligi\u00f3, mientras Trump no paraba de interrumpirle.\n\nHarris mantuvo una entrevista conjunta con Biden en 2020, cuando era candidata a la vicepresidencia, y la candidata dem\u00f3crata Clinton y su compa\u00f1ero de f\u00f3rmula, Tim Kaine, hicieron lo propio en 2016.\n\nDejando a un lado las disputas partidistas sobre la entrevista, hay muchas razones por las que tiene sentido que los candidatos presidenciales se sometan a duras entrevistas. Alguien que aspira a dirigir el pa\u00eds deber\u00eda sentirse en la obligaci\u00f3n de explicar lo que planea hacer, aunque sus directores de campa\u00f1a prefieran restringir sus apariciones a medios partidistas de bajo riesgo y a personas influyentes y emp\u00e1ticas en las redes sociales. Cuantas m\u00e1s entrevistas concede un pol\u00edtico, m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctica adquiere. Un plan de medios m\u00e1s s\u00f3lido podr\u00eda haber ayudado a Harris a perfeccionar sus habilidades antes de debatir con Trump.\n\nLas presidencias de \u00e9xito tambi\u00e9n se basan en el capital pol\u00edtico acumulado durante la campa\u00f1a. Puede que ya hayan pasado los d\u00edas en que las campa\u00f1as presidenciales se basaban en discursos pol\u00edticos de peso, y en esta carrera tan comprimida hay poco tiempo para tales actos.\n\nSin embargo, los candidatos presidenciales del pasado demostraron su credibilidad haciendo part\u00edcipes a los votantes de sus planes pol\u00edticos. En 1960, por ejemplo, el candidato dem\u00f3crata John F. Kennedy expuso durante la campa\u00f1a un programa sobre cuestiones como los derechos civiles, la vivienda y la pol\u00edtica exterior que se convirti\u00f3 en la base de los logros pol\u00edticos de su presidencia y de la posterior de Lyndon Johnson.\n\nLa entrevista de este jueves se produce en un momento en que los dem\u00f3cratas debaten si Harris debe concentrarse m\u00e1s en cuestiones pol\u00edticas o en establecer contrastes de car\u00e1cter con Trump, mientras dice a los votantes que tienen una oportunidad \"fugaz\" de pasar p\u00e1gina a su cacofon\u00eda.\n\nKate Bedingfield, exdirectora de comunicaciones de Biden en la Casa Blanca, dijo que Harris necesitaba aprovechar la ocasi\u00f3n para dejar claro por qui\u00e9n est\u00e1 luchando, y su promesa de proteger a los votantes de lo que ella considera ataques del Partido Republicano a sus libertades.\n\n\"Creo que no tiene que dejarse llevar demasiado por la idea de que esto tiene que ser un examen de doctorado de cada uno de los posibles puntos de un Gobierno Harris y utilizarlo realmente como una oportunidad para transmitir mensajes\", dijo Bedingfield, ahora comentarista de CNN.\n\nPero Leon Panetta, exdirector de la CIA, exsecretario de Defensa y ex secretario general de la Casa Blanca, dijo a Brianna Keilar, de CNN, que los candidatos deber\u00edan hablar de los temas en los que creen para demostrar que pueden llevar al pa\u00eds por un camino mejor.\n\nY a\u00f1adi\u00f3: \u201cM\u00e1s vale que sepan muy bien las respuestas a preguntas concretas, porque eso pondr\u00e1 a prueba si solo est\u00e1n hablando en t\u00e9rminos generales o si realmente tienen una pol\u00edtica concreta que quieren poner en marcha\"."

            "headline": "Internet helps Politico with its amnesia after it claims Vance is trying to 'tether' Biden to Harris",
            "text": "The liberal media has worked hard in recent weeks to help Democratic operatives rehabilitate Kamala Harris' public image. Essential to that effort has been her characterization as competent and capable \u2014 a task made all the more difficult by her track record as vice president and border czar over the past three years.\n\nEstablishmentarians' desperation to gloss over Harris' complicity in President Joe Biden's various failings and unpopular initiatives was crystallized in a Politico article this week, titled, \"'Our corrupt leadership': Vance tries to tether Harris to Biden during Michigan rally.\"\n\nCritics rushed to note that Vance doesn't have to do what Harris has already done \u2014 that there is a hyphen in \"Biden-Harris administration\" that both serves as a tether and cuts through the absurdity of Politico's framing.\n\nAll administration officials refer to the 'Biden-Harris administration' instead of the easier-to-say 'Biden administration.'\n\nIn fact, Politico has previously emphasized the existence of this hyphen.\n\nPolitico reported in early 2021 that:\n\nFor personnel announcements during the transition, officials were told to include quotes from both Biden and Harris. And all administration officials refer to the 'Biden-Harris administration' instead of the easier-to-say 'Biden administration.'\n\nVarious federal agencies followed suit, all making sure to tether Harris to Biden. Again, according to Politico, the \"Education Department was referring to the 'Biden-Harris administration' on its website from Day 1, with the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management following suit on Jan. 25.\"\n\nHarris has effectively been tethered to Biden since 2020.\n\n'Fast food industry tries to tie Ronald McDonald to McDonalds.'\n\nHarris' previous presidential campaign was a complete failure \u2014 so much so, she didn't even make it to the first vote. The New York Times indicated ahead of the campaign's collapse that Harris \"has proved to be an uneven campaigner who changes her message and tactics to little effect and has a staff torn into factions.\"\n\nAfter August 2019, when she was briefly polling around 10%, she took a massive nosedive in the polls and never recovered. Shortly after a poll revealed that a majority of Democrats in her own state of California wanted her to call it quits, she did so, bailing out in December 2019.\n\nBiden apparently took pity on Harris, telling reporters, \"I have mixed emotions about [her exit],\" and calling her a \"first-rate candidate.\" Ultimately, Biden permitted Harris to tether herself to him and together they proceeded to take power.\n\nIn the years since, Harris has routinely cosigned Biden's policy initiatives and decisions, including the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which Harris has boasted signing off on.\n\nDespite Harris' history of working hand in glove with Biden, Politico reported Tuesday, \"Former President Donald Trump's running mate tried to tie Harris to the Biden administration's policies \u2014 saying at one point that 'Kamala Harris has been calling the shots' \u2014 while also warning of China's emergence as an economic superpower that's taking jobs away from the U.S.\"\n\nPolitico's controversial suggestion that Vance is unfairly insinuating a link between Harris and Biden has been met with widespread ridicule as well as a community note on X.\n\nVance responded to the article on X, tweeting, \"The thing is: she's Biden's Vice President.\"\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) posted an image of the Biden-Harris 2024 logo, noting it was \"their campaign logo up and until a few weeks ago.\"\n\nBlaze News social media specialist Ben McDonald quipped, \"Fast food industry tries to tie Ronald McDonald to McDonalds.\"\n\n\"I knew the corporate press was shameless but I didn't realize that they were this stupid,\" wrote anarcho-capitalist author Michael Malice.\n\nAmid the backlash, Politico stealthily changed the title of its article without an editor's note admitting the alteration. At the time of publication, the article was titled, \"Vance warns of China\u2019s influence during Michigan rally.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

            "headline": "The Democrats Are United. Now What?",
            "text": "When Bill Clinton took the stage on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, he wasn\u2019t scanning the crowd to gauge their reaction the way he usually does. Instead, he was constantly glancing down at the dais. Clinton wasn\u2019t reading from the teleprompter; his speech had been printed out. \u201cBill Clinton is reading ... pages of actual paper,\u201d the longtime political reporter Susan Milligan tweeted. \u201cWhich, for those of us who started covering him in the \u201992 campaign, means he didn\u2019t finish his last version of his speech in time to load it on the teleprompter.\u201d\n\nClinton wasn\u2019t just fiddling with syntax. After observing the first two days of the convention, he had decided to rewrite his remarks \u201cwith a more fun, youthful, joyful approach\u201d that fit the mood he had witnessed inside the United Center. \u201cTake it from a man who once had the honor to be called in this convention the Man From Hope,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe need Kamala Harris, the president of joy, to lead us. So, I\u2019ll be doing my part. You do yours. I\u2019ll see you when we\u2019re making a real joyful noise when the votes are counted.\u201d\n\nIt was, to be blunt, not one of Clinton\u2019s better speeches\u2014long and droning, it resembled his disastrous 1988 address more than career highlights such as his reelection-shifting 1996 speech or his effusive case for Barack Obama in 2012. (It was also Clinton\u2019s thirteenth convention speech, so it\u2019s hard to fault him too much.) But it was yet another testament to the former president\u2019s well-honed ability to read the room. The theme of the 2024 convention was joy; Clinton simply put his own spin on it.\n\nMuch of that joy was Kamala Harris\u2019s. Democrats had rightly decided that exuberance was her defining characteristic, and spent four days making the case that in her the party had, at long last, its own happy warrior. But joy was also present in the United Center itself. It belonged to the delegates, too. The mood at the 2024 DNC was jubilant because everyone was well aware of how funereal things would have been if Harris wasn\u2019t the nominee. Had Biden held on, the convention would have likely taken place with Donald Trump rollicking toward a landslide return to the White House; moreover, there likely would have been massive protests against Biden\u2019s role in Israel\u2019s ongoing murder of civilians in Gaza. The media would have labeled it a reprise of the disastrous 1968 convention.\n\nInstead, Harris was the nominee; the protests were present but muted; and the Democrats, though still facing a tight election, were favorites. All of this was un-imaginable just one month earlier."

            "text": "Rumors that Beyonc\u00e9 would make an appearance were swirling inside the United Center by the third day of the Democratic National Convention. They hit TMZ a day later. But by the time balloons fell upon Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and the Democratic delegates, Beyonc\u00e9 was nowhere to be found. Nor was Taylor Swift, the subject of far less serious speculation about a \u201csurprise guest\u201d\u2014teased by dubiously sourced posters on the social media site X\u2014who failed to materialize. (Arguably, the surprise guest was actually the newly minted nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who had rocketed to the top of the Democratic ticket barely a month before.)\n\nBut attendees could hardly complain about the roster of celebrities who were in attendance. Rapper Common performed a version of his song \u201cFortunate,\u201d tailored to fit the DNC. (\u201cI thank God for this moment in time where Kamala Harris will change the world for the better with love, hope, and grace,\u201d the rapper declared.) Legendary singers Patti LaBelle and Stevie Wonder performed some of their biggest hits. Singer John Legend and drummer Sheila E. delivered a tribute to the late artist Prince that doubled as an opening act for Harris\u2019s running mate, Governor Tim Walz, who also hails from Minnesota. For the country-loving crowd, Mickey Guyton, Jason Isbell, and the Chicks all made appearances.\n\nRapper Lil Jon, a Georgia native, participated in his state\u2019s roll call vote to formally name Harris the nominee; actress Eva Longoria, who was born in Corpus Christi, did the same for Texas. (Jon performed his hit \u201cTurn Down for What\u201d but did not perform his frat-party standard \u201cGet Low,\u201d which famously details the sweat dripping down a certain anatomical region.) Pink performed alongside her daughter and backup singers for a mournful, acoustic version of her song \u201cWhat About Us.\u201d Actors Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling delivered remarks, and basketball star Stephen Curry appeared in a pretaped video; on night one, August 19, his coach, Steve Kerr, spoke about the value of teamwork. Celebrities could also occasionally be spotted on the floor of the arena: Oh look, there\u2019s Mark Hamill, there\u2019s Rosario Dawson, there\u2019s Spike Lee\u2014who looked generally more excited than he does when he sits courtside at Knicks games.\n\nOf course, convention attendees are exactly the sort of nerds who would consider a powerful politician a celebrity. Former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Barack Obama, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and Senator Elizabeth Warren were received with rapturous cheers. When 78-year-old former President Bill Clinton took the stage on night three, the reception was akin to that of fans of 81-year-old Mick Jagger; sure, he may be older and diminished, but it\u2019s Mick Jagger. (On the floor, one delegate said he would have voted for Clinton a third time if he could; several within earshot concurred.) The smorgasbord of famous people provided a sharp contrast to the Republican National Convention the month before. Democrats are generally smug about the quality and level of renown of their ideologically aligned celebrities as compared to those who support Republicans. (Unfortunately for Democrats, the U.S. Constitution does not grant George Clooney more weight in the Electoral College than your average Trump supporter.)\n\nJust one comparison: The RNC had wrestler Hulk Hogan extolling former President Donald Trump\u2019s toughness and ripping his shirt off onstage; the DNC featured a surprise speech by Oprah Winfrey. There is a measurable sociological impact of Winfrey\u2019s economic and political endorsements, aptly called the \u201cOprah Effect\u201d; if there\u2019s a \u201cKid Rock effect,\u201d it hasn\u2019t been studied yet."

Dutzende Stunden hatte sich der nationale Sicherheitsberater der USA mit Au\u00dfenminister Wang Yi und anderen Vertretern Chinas \u00fcber die vergangenen Monate getroffen. Nun betonte er die hohe Frequenz seiner \u201esehr detaillierten, sorgf\u00e4ltigen, mehrfachen\u201c Treffen, um die wiedergewonnene fragile Stabilit\u00e4t zwischen Washington und Peking aufrechtzuerhalten, insbesondere in Zeiten des Regierungswechsels.\n\nBesonders war dieser Donnerstag dann aber doch: Zum ersten Mal seit acht Jahren ist in Peking wieder ein nationaler Sicherheitsberater der USA von Staats- und Parteichef Xi Jinping empfangen worden. Zuvor traf Sullivan den Vizevorsitzenden der Milit\u00e4rkommission und dessen Stab im Hauptquartier der Volksbefreiungsarmee, die h\u00f6chste Milit\u00e4rvertretung unter Xi. Vergeblich hatte sich US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin bislang um ein Treffen mit General Zhang Youxia bem\u00fcht.\n\nXi: China nicht als Herausforderung betrachten\n\nPeking hat derzeit kein Interesse an einer weiteren Verschlechterung der Beziehungen. Das machte Xi deutlich, als er Sullivan sagte: \u201eWir hoffen, dass die Vereinigten Staaten mit China zusammenarbeiten werden, um einander entgegenzukommen\u201c. Die wichtigste Aufgabe sei \u201edie Entwicklung einer richtigen strategischen Wahrnehmung\u201c, so Xi sp\u00e4ter in der offiziellen Verlautbarung. Dazu geh\u00f6re f\u00fcr ihn, dass die USA China nicht als Herausforderung betrachten.\n\nAuf Nachfrage, ob China Sorgen vor der kommenden Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl habe, sagte Sullivan, \u201esie haben erkannt, dass Wahlen und Amts\u00fcberg\u00e4nge sensible Zeitr\u00e4ume sind\u201c. Im \u00dcbrigen sei die demokratische Kandidatin und Vizepr\u00e4sidentin Kamala Harris bereits \u201ezentrales Mitglied des Biden-Au\u00dfenpolitikteams\u201c sowie \u201ean der Gestaltung und Umsetzung der US-Indopazifikstrategie beteiligt\u201c und teile Bidens Ansichten.\n\nAngesprochen habe er auch Chinas Statusverschiebungen im S\u00fcdchinesischen Meer, in der Taiwanstra\u00dfe sowie Amerikas \u201etiefe Sorgen\u201c \u00fcber Pekings Hilfe f\u00fcr die russische Industrie. \u00dcber den Ukrainekrieg k\u00f6nne er jedoch \u201enicht sagen, dass wir da vorangekommen sind\u201c, so Sullivan.\n\nTreffen zwischen Biden und Xi m\u00f6glich\n\nEin Erfolg ist da eher die Wiederaufnahme milit\u00e4rischer Gespr\u00e4chskan\u00e4le, die Risiken vermeiden helfen sollen. China hatte die Gespr\u00e4che 2022 ausgesetzt, nachdem die damalige Sprecherin des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses, Nancy Pelosi, nach Taiwan geflogen war.\n\nNun sollen demn\u00e4chst die jeweiligen Regionalkommandeure f\u00fcr den Indopazifikraum per Video miteinander sprechen. Nach Angaben des chinesischen Verteidigungsministeriums sagte KP-Vizemilit\u00e4rkommissionschef Zhang zu Sullivan, die Welt erwarte, dass beide Seiten \u201edie Stabilit\u00e4t im milit\u00e4rischen und sicherheitspolitischen Bereich aufrechterhalten\u201c."

            "text": "Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will be tag-teaming their first major interview, spurring criticism from conservatives as well as some members of the so-called liberal media. The primetime sit-down set to air on CNN Thursday will be the first for Harris since the vice president secured the delegate votes to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cShould CNN have insisted on a one-on-one interview with Harris and turned down a joint interview with Harris and Walz?\u201d former CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller tweeted. \u201cToo tough to walk away from. But first question to Harris ought to be why should [sic] couldn\u2019t appear solo.\u201d\n\nKnoller is reinforcing the conservative talking point that Harris is unqualified and unprepared to be president. That talking point is loaded with racism and sexism, but it\u2019s also free of historical context or the clear track record of political candidates doing dual interviews with their running mates\u2014and journalists like Knoller should know better.\n\nWho could forget when Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, sat down to talk with Fox News dirtbag Jesse Watters in July? That\u2019s when Trump revealed his sorry reason for choosing the political kryptonite that is Vance. Spoiler alert: Vance was chosen because he liked Trump, \u201cmaybe more than anybody liked me.\u201d\n\nThen there was the profoundly awkward interview Trump did with his previous running mate, Mike Pence, in 2016. This was less than four years before Trump-inspired MAGA insurgents set about trying to hang the evangelical politician at the Capitol for refusing to stop the certification of electoral votes.\n\nTrump\u2019s opponent Hillary Clinton did an interview alongside her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, in 2016.\n\nRemember when Sen. Mitt Romney and his rising star Republican running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, sat down with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2012?\n\nAnd in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama sat down with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d alongside his running mate, then-Sen. Joe Biden.\n\nKeep in mind that Harris is in a unique situation because incumbent Biden announced his decision to drop out of the race a mere 38 days ago, setting the stage for her historic run. Unlike Trump, who literally never stopped campaigning (even when he became president) or any previous presidential candidate, Harris hasn\u2019t had a year or more to campaign and grant numerous interviews. Instead, she has had little more than one month to vet and choose a running mate, build a coalition of supporters in record time, hold rallies across the country, and pull off a wildly successful Democratic National Convention.\n\nConsidering Harris and Walz\u2019s excellent chemistry, Thursday night\u2019s interview should be a fun watch. Tune in to watch the joyful duo continue to trigger the hell out of right-wingers everywhere.\n\nRepublished with permission from Daily Kos."

            "text": "According to an early memo, the group\u2019s staffers have done extensive research on the \u201cmanagement, personnel, policy, financial, and administrative\u201d strategies behind running the federal government and conducted more than one thousand interviews with former administration officials. The group has reportedly analyzed every one of Joe Biden\u2019s executive actions and drafted more than a hundred of their own proposed ones, according to Politico.\n\nBecause the group has 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, it does not disclose its donors, but it is well-funded, raking in $23.6 million in 2022. As a nonprofit, AFPI cannot openly support a candidate for office, and thus far it has not directly claimed any influence in the Trump campaign\u2014possibly learning from the mistakes of the Heritage Foundation, from which Trump has tried and failed to distance himself.\n\nBut at the end of the day, AFPI isn\u2019t so different from the conservative think tanks that have crashed and burned before it. While the official plan is still being built out, the group\u2019s broad agenda hits on many familiar conservative beats. The group advocates to finish building Trump\u2019s border wall, to deregulate the federal government and limit spending, as well as to increase oil and gas production."

            "headline": "It Just Got Easier to Dive to Shipwrecks in Lake Michigan",
            "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration just finished implementing some long-overdue safety precautions in Lake Michigan\u2014not to protect ships, but shipwrecks.\n\nNOAA established the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary in 2021, turning a 962-square-mile area of Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Michigan shore into a protected environmental and archaeological heritage site. Conceived as part of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s goal of promoting \u201clocally led, collaborative conservation,\u201d according to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, the sanctuary includes 36 historically significant shipwrecks, 21 of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nNow, three years later, NOAA has completed a project to install buoys and mooring lines around 19 of these shipwrecks, helping scuba divers locate them [PDF] and, more importantly, preventing functional ships from accidentally damaging their sunken brethren. Instead of dropping anchors that could damage underwater artifacts, ships can now fasten themselves to the mooring lines.\n\nCheck Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself\n\nOver 1500 wrecks are believed to lie at the bottom of Lake Michigan, and some dating as far back as the 17th century, well before the American Revolution. The Northerner, for example, was an 81-foot-long, double masted schooner used to transport lumber across Lake Michigan. The schooner made its final voyage in 1868, meeting its end as the result of an improperly plugged leak. It now lies 130 feet below the surface within the marine sanctuary.\n\nBuilt in 1851, the well-preserved schooner \u2018Northerner\u2019 lies in 130 feet of water. / Tamara Thomsen, Wisconsin Historical Society\n\nAnother noteworthy shipwreck found at the bottom of the sanctuary is the Selah Chamberlain, a 212-foot-long, engine-powered vessel that was owned and operated by a Vermont-born businessman of the same name. When it transported coal, iron ore, and wheat between Duluth, Minnesota, and Buffalo, New York, it was \u201coften seen towing a consort to further increase the carrying capacity,\u201d the Wisconsin Shipwrecks database notes.\n\nThe Selah Chamberlain met its end in 1886, when inclement weather and poor visibility caused the ship to collide with another vessel, the John Pridgeon Jr. The Selah Chamberlain cut its consort free and made for shore, but sank before it could reach land.\n\nGraveyard of the Great Lakes\n\nThese sunken ships are just a fraction of the 5000 to 10,000 wrecks believed to pepper the bottoms of the five Great Lakes.\n\nTrading vessels like the 95-foot long schooner \u2018Gallinipper\u2019 linked Wisconsin coastal cities with distant markets in the 1830s and 1840s, fueling local and regional economies. / Wisconsin Historical Society\n\nThe lakes have played a big role in North America\u2019s shipping industry, but that history is shot through with tragedy. Freshwater ice, rapidly fluctuating water levels, and the unpredictable movement of sand banks make the Great Lakes a perilous place, and that\u2019s not even including bad weather. The frequent maelstroms, formed by clashes between Arctic air flows from the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains and warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico, can cause waves 30 feet high. Many believe one of these unpredictable storms led to the mysterious wreck of the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior in November 1975. All 29 crew members died.\n\nToday, the Great Lakes sustain a vibrant ecosystem of maritime tourism and research. Because of Lake Michigan\u2019s cold, fresh water, many of the ships claimed by its waters have been incredibly well preserved, drawing attention from scuba divers and researchers alike. And thanks to NOAA\u2019s new buoying and mooring system, they are more accessible than ever.\n\nRead More Fascinating Stories About Shipwrecks:\n\nmanual"
