            "headline": "Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?",
            "text": "Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?\n\nGetty Images\n\nThree weeks ago, just days after being formally chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was pressed on her plans for a sit-down interview. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to my team,\u201d she told reporters on the airport tarmac in Detroit. \u201cI want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\u201d On Thursday night, Ms Harris will - just barely - make good on that promise, sitting down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for her first major interview. But Ms Harris will not be there by herself. The vice-president will be joined by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for the prime-time appearance, airing at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST). Ms Harris may have answered the question of when she would conduct an in-depth, substantive discussion of her candidacy and agenda - standard procedure for all major party presidential candidates. But with Mr Walz in tow, the decision to make this a joint appearance may also fuel growing criticism that after escaping the rigours of a months-long presidential primary, she is now dodging the scrutiny that comes with a solo interview.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly weak, weak sauce, to show up with your running mate,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W Bush, on CNN, adding that Harris had a \u201ctroubling lack of confidence\" in her own political ability. Still, supporters of Ms Harris insist that given the unprecedented nature of her candidacy following President Joe Biden's sudden departure from the race, she is taking things at a smart pace. \u201cI think the cadence has been right,\u201d said Peter Giangreco, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. \u201cWin the nomination, pick your nominee, lay out your economic plan, do your convention and now do some sit-downs and amplify that.\u201d Joint interviews featuring both members of a presidential ticket are not unusual. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sat for an interview with 60 minutes after Mr Biden was selected as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Eight years later, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did the same. For Ms Harris and Mr Biden in 2020, they picked ABC\u2019s 20/20. And less than a week after Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the pair were jointly interviewed on Fox. But since Mr Biden passed the torch to her late last month, Ms Harris has limited most of her engagement with the press to scripted and highly-controlled environments. Her last formal sit-down interview was on 24 June, more than two months and a political lifetime ago. Her occasional interactions with reporters - brief answers to shouted questions on her way to and from campaign events - have done little to quell Republican claims that she is shirking any opportunity to have her record and agenda put under the microscope.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe harshest criticism comes from her Republican opponents, who have both given several interviews in the past month. \u201cShe\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Mr Trump told media earlier in August. \u201cShe won\u2019t do interviews with friendly people because she can\u2019t do better than Biden.\u201d The Democratic nominee has enjoyed a surge in momentum since entering the race. Now, after her whirlwind introduction to American voters, she needs to \"reinforce\" that energy, said Republican strategist and Trump critic Chip Felkel. \u201cShe\u2019s gotta get out there,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got to show that she can think under pressure, because that\u2019s part of what the president has to do.\u201d Since she campaigned in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Ms Harris has switched her stance on several key policy positions, backing off some of her more liberal promises. She has abandoned pledges to support Medicare for all (giving all Americans access to government-funded healthcare) and to ban fracking. And the vice-president now supports a bipartisan border bill that includes hundreds of millions of dollars on a border wall, something Ms Harris once called \"un-American\". These apparent changes could open her up to questions about being a policy flip-flopper - an unwelcome label for a candidate still trying to define herself. But by doing a joint interview, the Harris campaign may have calculated that the pressure - and the difficult questions - will at least be shared between the two of them. And it ensures both are in lockstep when it comes to explaining policy. Mr Giangreco, the Democratic strategist, predicted Ms Harris and Mr Walz will try to turn the focus onto their economic plan, an agenda to lower the cost of living and provide economic security that she first announced at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, two weeks ago. Mr Giangreco also pointed to another potential benefit of a joint interview: drawing a contrast between Mr Walz and his Republican counterpart JD Vance who he has labelled as \"weird\".\n\nKamala Harris accepts Democratic nomination 'on behalf of the people'"

            "headline": "Walz\u2019s Campaign Trail Includes Stories of Helping With Lice on Facetime, Talking About the Perils of Gutters",
            "text": "When Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate for this November\u2019s presidential election, most Americans had no idea who the Minnesota governor actually was. But as people outside of Minnesota get to know Walz, it\u2019s becoming clear through a torrent of stories shared online that he\u2019s one of the most likable politicians around. Why? He just seems like a very normal and kind person. And it\u2019s hard to find a sharper contrast between Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate JD Vance than \u201cnormal and kind.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump and Vance are clearly frustrated with being called \u201cweird,\u201d a verbal jab against modern Republicans that was first popularized by Walz. But Trump and Vance are clearly stumped about how to hit back. Because every new day online seems to deliver an anecdote or story from Walz that makes him seem both relatable and caring. And after years of Trumpism dominating the headlines with an ideology built on cruelty and humiliation, a guy like Walz is extremely refreshing.\n\nTake an old story about Walz that started going viral on Wednesday. Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, was interviewed by Politico about the fact that she would become the first Native American woman to be governor of any state. At the end of the interview, Flanagan told a story about how Walz helped her when her child got lice.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nI heard you say that your daughter was discovered to have lice the day after the 2018 election. Can you share how the newly elected Walz-Flanagan ticket handled that early crisis? My first instinct was to call Congressman Tim Walz, also governor-elect Tim Walz, to say, \u201cHelp, my child has lice, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d So that was interesting. But he was amazing. I was super freaked out. We\u2019d never dealt with it before. Siobhan was a total trooper. He said, \u201cGo to Target, and then FaceTime me from the aisle.\u201d And so I did. He had me show all the different shampoos and stuff. He was like, \u201cThis is the one that you get.\u201d And then he\u2019s like, \u201cOnce you get home, FaceTime me again.\u201d So I FaceTimed him again from the bathroom, as I\u2019m picking nits out of my child\u2019s hair. And he was amazing and coached me through the whole thing, and that is who Tim Walz is.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of story that we\u2019re hearing more and more about Walz over the years. As a teacher and coach, he touched the lives of so many people as a helpful father figure, as so many of his former students tell it. And the army of pro-Trump trolls who are trying to take him down just don\u2019t understand his appeal.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s been going viral this week involving Walz is his interview with Subway Takes on TikTok. Walz discusses how important he thinks good gutter maintenance is. And it\u2019s just the latest example of Walz talking about normal things that normal people discuss in their everyday lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to post the most vile things imaginable on social media. For example, Trump retweeted an image on Truth Social that showed Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris with the caption, \u201cFunny how blowjobs impacted both of their careers differently.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d as it were is that Clinton\u2019s husband was involved with a White House intern in the 1990s and Harris was dating Willie Brown. The right has repeatedly tried to claim, without any evidence, that she only succeeded professionally because she was dating Brown. It\u2019s a common attack from retrograde assholes. But normal people don\u2019t find it amusing. At least they don\u2019t anymore.\n\nThe late-night comedians of the 1990s tore Monica Lewinsky to shreds with those kinds of jokes. But here in the 2020s, the U.S. public sees Lewinsky much differently than she was depicted in late 20th-century news and comedy programs. And that\u2019s probably why these assholes don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re the weird ones. Guys like Trump and Vance are trying to bring America back to the 1990s, back when Trump thought he was hot shit and Vance was a kid. Both men are trying to turn back the clock, from their stupid jokes to their ideas about reproductive health. But there\u2019s a reason that Harris has embraced a slogan that really seems to resonate with most people: We\u2019re not going back."

            "headline": "X Straightens Up Grok After Election Misinformation Warnings",
            "text": "Few mainstream social media sites have become more inundated with misinformation since the 2020 presidential election than X. Elon Musk bought the platform formerly known as Twitter in late 2022 and quickly instituted policies that allowed the worst elements of society to thrive. But X reportedly fixed at least one problem recently identified by several state attorneys general with the AI chatbot Grok. And it may be a small fix, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nWhat was the problem with X\u2019s Grok? Apparently, when you asked it questions about the 2024 election, the AI would repeatedly get things wrong about election laws. When President Joe Biden stepped aside on July 21 to allow Kamala Harris to run, Grok users were fed all kinds of information that simply wasn\u2019t true when asked about how things would change in the race.\n\nThe secretaries of state for Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Washington all wrote a joint letter to Elon Musk and X about the problems on August 5. The letter laid out some of the most concerning problems, like the answers Grok would give about whether Harris still had time to get on the ballot to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nFrom the letter, which was also published online:\n\nWithin hours of President Joe Biden stepping away from his presidential candidacy on July 21, 2024, false information on ballot deadlines produced by Grok was shared on multiple social media platforms. The post from Grok said, \u201cThe ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election. Some of these states include: 1. Alabama 2. Indiana 3. Michigan 4. Minnesota 5. New Mexico 6. Ohio 7. Pennsylvania 8. Texas 9. Washington.\u201d This is false. In all nine states the opposite is true: The ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nWhile the letter notes Grok is only available to paying subscribers on X, and includes a disclaimer about the fact that Grok can get things wrong, the secretaries of state noted how the false information about ballot deadlines had \u201cbeen captured and shared repeatedly in multiple posts\u2014reaching millions of people.\u201d And that\u2019s the bigger problem. Grok is a relatively niche service for people who are dumb enough to give Elon Musk money. However, the information from Grok can spread far and wide if people share screenshots on X and other social media sites. Especially if that information confirms existing biases or preconceived notions for confused individuals, like the idea that Harris is somehow ineligible to become president.\n\nBut Grok has reportedly been fixed, at least when it comes to information about ballot deadlines. The secretaries of state released a new letter on Monday praising X for doing something about it. Grok now directs users to Vote.gov, which has accurate information about voting rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate X\u2019s action to improve their platform and hope they continue to make improvements that will ensure their users have access to accurate information from trusted sources in this critical election year,\u201d the new letter reads. \u201cElections are a team effort, and we need and welcome any partners who are committed to ensuring free, fair, secure, and accurate elections.\u201d\n\nAs the secretaries of state note, the finer points of election rules can vary by state, which can make it difficult to keep things straight. But Vote.gov has the information that people need. And as long as Grok directs people there, rather than making shit up, things should be alright.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., all elections are run by local officials, who are supported and overseen by a state agency,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cElection rules and procedures can vary widely from state to state, and voters should seek out information from their local election officials about who can vote when they can vote, and how they can vote in their area. Websites like Vote.gov and CanIVote.org are also trustworthy resources that can connect voters with their local election officials.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to register to vote. Depending on where you live, the deadline could be coming soon."

            "headline": "Harris' first sit-down interview as nominee airs Thursday with pressure building",
            "text": "Harris explains policy shifts and her 'day one' in 1st sit-down interview as nominee\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nVice President Harris outlined her day-one agenda to support middle-class families if she were to win the election this fall in her first sit-down interview since becoming the Democratic nominee for president. She addressed plans to make housing more affordable and to expand the child tax credit, and she acknowledged that despite economic growth since the pandemic, prices are still too high for many Americans.\n\n\u201cPrices, in particular for groceries, are still too high. The American people know it. I know it,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris, who was joined by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sat down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for the interview during a campaign swing in Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe wide-ranging conversation was a high-stakes moment for Harris, after she had faced mounting pressure to do an interview with a major news outlet to share her own policies and take questions on her prior positions, some of which have changed since she became President Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020.\n\nBash pressed Harris on her shifted stances on both banning fracking and decriminalizing border crossings. Harris in 2019, when she first ran for president, said she was against a fracking ban and was for decriminalizing border crossings. Her stance on both policies has changed since then \u2014 but Harris insisted that her values have not.\n\n\u201cI think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is, my values have not changed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\u201d\n\nHarris said she would keep her word that she would not ban fracking \u2014 an issue that is front and center in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd on decriminalizing border crossings, Harris said, \u201cI believe there should be consequences. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHarris also addressed foreign policy, namely the continued U.S. aid to Israel in its war in Gaza. When asked if Harris would withhold some shipments of weapons to Israel, Harris did not directly answer the question, and instead reiterated her call for a ceasefire deal and getting the hostages home.\n\n\u201cI remain committed since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self determination and dignity,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the interview, Harris also committed to having a Republican in her presidential cabinet \u2013 and said it would be to the benefit of the American public to have someone who has different views and different experiences working with her.\n\nThe interview was wide-ranging, covering Walz\u2019s record and past controversies, President Biden\u2019s legacy and ability to serve, as well as the phone call between Biden and Harris the day he decided to step down from the race.\n\nQuestions over Walz\u2019 comments on weapons of war, and his path to having children\n\nWalz had only a few questions directed at him during the interview. He was asked about previous comments he made in 2018 about carrying a weapon into war \u2013 which Walz never did. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war and my wife, the English teacher, telling me my grammar is not always correct,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cMy record speaks for itself\u2026 I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWalz and his wife used a method known as IUI to have children \u2013 but has said they used IVF in the past. On that issue, Walz said he thinks most Americans \u201cget it if you\u2019ve been through that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child,\u201d he said.\n\nNew details on the call between Biden and Harris when Biden stepped down\n\nHarris revealed that she was spending time with her family, cooking breakfast and about to sit down for a puzzle when Biden called her last month to let her know he was ending his campaign for reelection.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 \u201d Harris said.\n\nShe noted that Biden made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that he was going to support Harris\u2019 campaign for president. She called the president \u201cselfless\u201d and said he puts the American people first.\n\nRepublicans like Trump had been accusing Harris of trying to dodge tough questions\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a month since Biden dropped out of the race, and in the absence of a 1-on-1 Harris interview or press conference, Republicans have accused the vice president of trying to dodge the press to avoid tough questions. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done an interview,\u201d former President Donald Trump said during a news conference earlier this month at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent, and she can\u2019t do an interview.\u201d\n\nPrior to becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris had taken plenty of questions from reporters as the sitting vice president. Her team says she\u2019s done 80 interviews this year \u2014 in traditional, network media as well as on podcasts and social media.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut in these previous conversations she was generally selling Biden\u2019s agenda. Like most vice presidents, she was a messenger and a deputy. Now, she\u2019s running for the top job, and this CNN interview may be one of the first times she\u2019s pressed to spell out her own policies and answer questions about how, if at all, she would govern differently than Biden.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d have to answer more of these questions,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible to run for president and not answer them.\u201d\n\nHarris will, undoubtedly, face additional scrutiny about her record and positions when she faces off against Trump in the debate expected next month.\n\nTrump, for his part, posted on his platform Truth Social as the interview with Harris aired on CNN.\n\n\u201cI look so forward to Debating Comrade Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is. Harris has changed every one of her long held positions, on everything,\u201d he said. He also posted: \u201cBORING!!!\u201d\n\n"

Now they finally have a presidential ticket that explicitly echoes their agenda.\n\nThese activists and their diverse coalition \u2014 who call themselves YIMBYs, for \"yes in my backyard\" \u2014 have sprung into action to support Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. On Wednesday night, they held a two-hour virtual \"YIMBYs for Harris\" fundraiser featuring dozens of local, state, and federal lawmakers who believe in building lots more housing.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nPro-housing advocates say Harris' proposal to build 3 million homes in her first term, in part through cutting government regulations restricting construction, feels like a big shift toward addressing the country's housing shortage. It doesn't hurt that Harris selected as her running mate a governor who has championed pro-housing policies in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris and other top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, highlighted the housing shortage in their speeches at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 sending YIMBYs into a tizzy. Democrats in Washington have long supported demand-side housing policies, including subsidies for homebuyers and low-income renters. But recent national messaging on the issue has focused much more squarely on solving the supply shortage, which is particularly severe in blue states and cities where onerous permitting requirements, environmental reviews, and opposition from so-called NIMBYs \u2014 \"not in my backyard\" \u2014 have hamstrung efforts to build more homes.\n\n\"There's always been Democrats saying we should fund more affordable housing,\" Armand Domalewski, a San Francisco-based data analyst who helped organize YIMBYs for Harris, told Business Insider. What's new on the national stage, he added, is \"the perspective that part of the issue is local and state governments obstructing housing.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nShortly after Domalewski set up a WhatsApp group for pro-housing voters about three weeks ago, \"it just exploded,\" he said. About 300 people are in the chat, he said, and the group estimated that about 6,000 people attended Wednesday's virtual fundraiser, which raised more than $100,000.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, a headliner at the fundraiser, argued that his party was experiencing a \"generational shift\" in its approach to housing. He's called Harris \"the first presidential nominee in at least a generation that cares about housing.\" Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado similarly described Harris at the event as \"the most pro-housing president in the history of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want somebody that is actually going to work to solve the problem of the housing shortage,\" Schatz said. \"And the simplest way to solve the problem of the housing shortage is to make it permissible for people to build as much housing as they can, especially for working people.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, a 46-year-old California Democrat who's been one of the loudest urbanist voices in Congress, noted in his remarks during the fundraiser that he was organizing the first YIMBY congressional caucus.\n\nThe fact that housing policy is high on the list of national Democratic priorities indicates how severe the affordability crisis has gotten. Harris, Obama, and other top Democrats aren't suddenly YIMBY converts \u2014 they're talking about the housing shortage because Americans are more worried about it. In a recent survey , 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans said they thought a lack of affordable housing was a significant problem.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't said much on the campaign trail about housing, though he and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have argued they could solve the supply shortage by deporting millions of immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral speakers at the YIMBY fundraiser argued that, despite being the anti-regulation party, Republicans had embraced red tape that limits what can be built and where. In the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 agenda, Ben Carson, who was Trump's secretary of housing and urban development, wrote that Republicans should \"oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning.\""

However, if nothing is done to address the dearth of housing supply, then jump-starting nationwide demand will simply exacerbate the housing crisis as people scramble to snatch up already-scarce homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The demand side doesn't help over the long run,\" Olsen said. \"If you want sweeping policy that's very generalizable, have it be on the supply side.\"\n\nOlsen also doesn't think the first-time homebuyer criteria is the most useful way to increase housing access for those who need it the most.\n\n\"I could be a first-time buyer, but I have a great network, a bank of mom and dad, that could help me move forward. And now you've given me an extra boost,\" Olsen said.\n\nFocusing on boosting first-generation homeownership could help combat that issue, which Harris' plan addresses, although the exact details have yet to be revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Olsen believes a federal down payment assistance plan is simply a band-aid fix for structural issues in the US housing market \u2014 namely, lack of supply.\n\n\"It can end up just getting us revved up without solving the long-run problem,\" Olsen said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHere's what will actually help home affordability\n\nThat's not to say that all down payment assistance plans are doomed to fail. When done right, these programs can be quite beneficial, Olsen said.\n\nThe key comes down to whether such a plan is implemented at the federal or local level. According to Olsen, local homebuying incentives that increase demand are more targeted than a blanket federal policy like the one Harris proposed, making them more effective in increasing homeowning accessibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, a state with a low population might have a lot of underused infrastructure. In this case, incentives to boost housing demand at the state level could help redistribute people to areas with excess home supply.\n\n\"If you want to solve things with the demand side of the coin for the long run, it's gonna be more about 'How do I get the people to want to go where the supply is?'\" Olsen said.\n\nBut again, Olsen believes that policies increasing the housing supply are the most effective way to alleviate the current housing crisis.\n\nHarris has actually put out proposals addressing the supply side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion aims to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. The fund will provide $20 billion in funding to lower land use restrictions, modernize zoning policies, stimulate development, and encourage innovative housing solutions. This plan emphasizes building multifamily rental units and starter homes for middle-class families, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of units.\n\nAnd the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit provides tax credits to developers who build affordable housing units, which helps low-income tenants in finding affordable and available units. This policy encourages mixed-income developments such as multifamily housing rented to tenants from a variety of income backgrounds."

            "text": "Harris is on a 2-day Georgia bus tour. It\u2019s the latest sign the state is in play\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are back on their campaign bus. The pair are together on the campaign trail for the first time since last week\u2019s Democratic convention. This time, they\u2019re on a two-day bus tour of Georgia.\n\nTheir trip is taking them into areas of the state that don\u2019t always get attention from Democratic politicians. It will also be the site of Harris\u2019 first major network interview since becoming her party\u2019s nominee for president, on Thursday.\n\nThe attention this week is just the latest sign that Georgia, a state President Biden narrowly won in 2020, is once again in play this election year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThis area is a priority for the campaign: we have nearly 50 full-time staff across 7 offices in South Georgia,\u201d said Porsha White, the Georgia state director for the Harris campaign, ahead of the trip. \u201cThis will be the first time a general election presidential candidate will have campaigned in Savannah since the 1990s.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpon arrival in Savannah, Harris and Walz greeted students from Savannah State University, the oldest public HBCU in Georgia, before boarding their campaign bus.\n\nTheir first stop on Wednesday was to a marching band rehearsal at Liberty County High School, which, according to U.S. News and World Report, has about 1,000 students, a majority of them \u201ceconomically disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nThe room erupted when Harris and Walz walked in, and the band played the school fight song with football players and cheerleaders in the back of the room. Leaning into his experience as a former coach, Walz gave a quick speech about teamwork. Harris told the crowd they were all leaders in their own way.\n\nNext stop: Sandfly Bar-B-Q in Savannah, a restaurant decorated with license plates from various states. Harris and Walz were greeted by the restaurant's owner, employees and local patrons. Walz sought out a group of teachers and praised their \u201cnoble\u201d work. He talked about the importance of optimism and insisted, \u201cOur politics can be hopeful.\u201d Outside, a man held a Trump flag.\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Harris stopped by Dottie\u2019s Market in Savannah, where she told the owner she plans to announce a tax credit to boost small business creation. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to be rolling out next week is basically a tax credit for startups, small business startups,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLater was a rally at the city's Enmarket Arena, where she outlined her vision to \"fight for America\u2019s future\" that included Medicaid expansion, focusing on middle- and working-class families and expanding reproductive rights.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader strategy to reach voters in traditionally Republican areas in swing states\n\nSavannah \u2014 like most major cities \u2014 votes strongly Democratic. But it is swimming in a sea of red \u2014 and that\u2019s where Harris and Walz are campaigning.\n\n\u201cThe whole point is to overperform,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie. \u201cAnd so you want to overperform not just among your base, but you also want to overperform in places where you have historically been weak.\u201d\n\nThat means campaigning far from the Democratic strongholds of Atlanta, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C., to narrow the margins in parts of those competitive swing states that have typically voted Republican. In other words, losing by less.\n\nIn Georgia, where reliably Republican voters still outnumber reliably Democratic ones, that\u2019s really the only way to have a chance at winning.\n\n\u201cDemocrats also want to perform better than they historically have in other parts of the state, so you want to be able to post stronger margins \u2014 even if they are losing margins \u2014 in other parts of the state,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nBoth campaigns put money and time into Georgia\n\nIn presidential races, there are two big indicators of how campaigns are feeling about their chances in a state: time and money. Since Harris got into the race, Donald Trump and his allies have spent nearly $33 million on ads in the state, mostly trying to define Harris with pretty negative messaging. Meanwhile Harris and her allies have spent nearly $23 million, mostly on more positive ads introducing her to voters. That\u2019s according to an NPR analysis of data from the tracking firm Ad Impact. People watching TV in Georgia are seeing a ton of campaign ads already.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToday, the Harris campaign launched its first \u201ccontrast\u201d ad, hitting Trump and tying him to the unpopular conservative roadmap known as Project 2025. That will be on heavy rotation in Georgia and other swing states.\n\ntoggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Harris campaign has invested in 24 offices around Georgia, including in more traditionally Republican areas. Since Harris started running for president, White says they\u2019ve brought in 35,000 new volunteers.\n\nAs for time: Trump held a rally in Georgia earlier this month \u2014 though he spent part of his speech bashing the state\u2019s Republican governor. (Trump has since made a public show of saying they\u2019ve worked things out.) This week\u2019s bus tour is Harris\u2019 second trip to the state in less than a month.\n\nPolling averages show the race remains close \u2014 and it\u2019s much closer with Harris at the top of the ticket than when Biden was the presumptive nominee . Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes. But the state\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators are proof that a Democrat can win if they run a near-perfect campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign will also be turning up the heat in the state this week in an effort to win it back. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene plans to head to a volunteer phone bank in Rome, Ga. In a release she cites \u201cdozens of paid staff, thousands of volunteers, and field offices in every part of the state, from Atlanta to Savannah to the Valdosta. Team Trump will not leave a stone unturned this fall.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, Georgia is a must-win state. For Harris, it would open up additional paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win.\n\n\n\nHarris and Walz will take a pitstop in Georgia to do an interview\n\nAs Harris and Walz meet voters in person, they are also set to sit down for their first television interview together. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash interviewed them at Kim\u2019s Cafe, a Black-owned restaurant in Savannah, this afternoon. It will air at 9 p.m. EST on CNN.\n\nFor the entirety of Harris\u2019 nascent candidacy, she has been in a position to control the message, and she has largely delivered prepared remarks from teleprompter. The interview is, of course, a different format, where she is likely to be pressed on areas where her position has changed since the Democratic primary in 2020, when she supported some version of Medicare for All, opposed fracking and didn\u2019t have as hard of a line on immigration and border security as she does now.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe won\u2019t be alone. Walz will also be part of the interview, which means there likely will be some questions about their relationship and how they would work together \u2014 questions that by their nature are not as perilous as trying to explain policy shifts.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been publicly badgering Harris to do an interview, in part because they are looking for something to pounce on where they can actually get some traction. They have been trying unsuccessfully for five weeks to end her campaign honeymoon and make some attacks stick, and this interview is the best chance they\u2019ve had in a while.\n\nAlready, Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance is criticizing Harris and Walz for doing a joint appearance rather than having Harris sit for a grilling alone. But it\u2019s not clear how much voters really care about these intricacies."

He is accused of running the platform where these crimes took place, not committing the crimes himself. Durov co-founded the popular messaging app in 2013.

Telegram users typically find the service attractive due to its limited oversight of what they can say. This has made the app a favorite tool for far-right extremist groups, terrorist organizations and criminal gangs. Investigators say Durov failed to cooperate with them, which would have helped them shut down the illegal operations. He is now under judicial supervision and banned from leaving French territory.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump shared a TikTok video yesterday including footage that likely violates federal law against using military cemeteries for campaigning purposes. The video was posted after NPR reported Trump campaign staffers had a physical altercation Monday with an Arlington National Cemetery staffer who was trying to enforce restrictions during a remembrance ceremony.

She found in her reporting that these efforts have swept up U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote. Maintaining voter rolls is a critical election safeguard and federal law says it can\u2019t happen within 90 days of an election. Advocacy groups have asked Tennessee and Alabama to halt sending letters to people they suspect are noncitizens, saying it's violating federal law. Tennessee later said people who received letters wouldn\u2019t be purged from voter rolls.

            "headline": "What's Your 'Sleep Language'? Here Are the 5 Different Types and How to Speak Yours",
            "text": "There's a reason why experts suggest adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. From preventing forgetfulness to impacting your life expectancy, there's a laundry list of health reasons you should be getting quality sleep each night. However, reaching that goal isn't always easy. It can be difficult to find the correct code of hacks to unlock your sleep potential and get the rest your body needs.\n\nShelby Harris, a clinical sleep psychologist, is aiming to crack that code through partnership with the popular meditation app and mental health brand Calm. Harris and Calm have published a working understanding of the \"five sleep languages\" -- a sectioning off of a few different sleeping patterns (or lack thereof) to give people more actionable steps to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNET\n\nHarris said she came up with the five different sleep languages after considering differences among her patients over her 20 years of experience and noticing that there are a handful of categories they tend to fall into.\n\n\"We can give people a whole list of sleep hygiene targets to follow or when they should see a sleep doctor, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming for people,\" Harris said. The goal of the different sleep languages is to meet people where they are in their sleep health journey.\n\n\"It helps to guide where they want to go with what they can start with.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about your sleep language and how to use this knowledge to improve your sleep. For more advice on how to improve your sleep quality, here are eight ways to promote sleepiness and how your diet is linked to your sleep.\n\nThe 5 sleep languages and tips for speaking yours\n\nHarris has landed on five sleep languages, but it's important to note you can switch between them throughout your lifetime, she says.\n\nBelow are the five sleep languages, as described in Calm's blog.\n\n1. The 'gifted' sleeper\n\nIf you're a gifted sleeper, you probably appear to the people around you just as that -- gifted, in the name of sleep. Maybe you can fall asleep anywhere, no matter the noise or background light, or you have no problem napping. Any way you slice it, the gifted sleeper typically doesn't have a problem falling or staying asleep.\n\nTips for the gifted sleeper\n\nWhile this may seem like the \"best\" sleep language category to belong to, objectively speaking, gifted sleepers might want to see a sleep doctor if they're sleeping too much, as it could be a sign of a health condition. It can be especially important to follow up with a doctor if you're sleeping a lot but still not feeling well rested.\n\nBut if there isn't something else at play, consider whether you're actually playing catchup on sleep deprivation and whether you can benefit from a stricter sleep routine, according to the Calm post.\n\n2. The 'words of worry' sleeper\n\nIf you're a \"words of worry\" sleeper, you might know who you are. Your brain is loud at night, clouded with the \"what ifs\" of the day, and what you have to get done tomorrow. Whether it be the past or the present, a words of worry sleeper is focused on another time other than the present and the physical focus at hand: sleep.\n\nTips those who worry about sleep\n\n\"I have a lot of patients that come to me where their brains just won't turn off,\" Harris said. If you can relate to this, be clear on your sleep boundaries and limit things like screen time, or cross-contaminating nonsleep activities in the bedroom, like work. You may also benefit from adding a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation to your day, or trying this CNET to-do list hack for better sleep.\n\nWorking or scrolling in bed is a no-go when you're looking to improve your sleep. Skaman306/Getty Images\n\n3. The 'routine perfectionist' sleeper\n\nIf you're a perfectionist sleeper, you may have followed our sleep advice a little too hard to the detriment of your happiness, and sometimes, your sleep. You may be a perfectionist sleeper if you find yourself missing out on fun events, or other special occasions that may be important to you, over fear of having one night of poor sleep. Or when something or someone throws your sleep off, you're irritated.\n\n\"Those people I often see because they used to be a words of worry person or have some type of sleep issue, that then they became hyperobsessed with it,\" Harris said.\n\nTips for those a little too perfect about sleep\n\nAs laid out in the Calm blog, perfectionist sleepers will benefit from a little more flexibility and switching things up -- things that will create \"less attachment\" to your sleep routine. To get started, move around the order of your sleep routine slightly (maybe you'll brush your teeth before you put on your pajamas today, for example).\n\nLike the other sleep languages, a perfect sleeper may benefit from practicing mindfulness, which can improve your ability to relate to anxiety-inducing thoughts in a way that's not so stressful.\n\n4. The 'too hot to handle' sleeper\n\nIt's in the name, but if you're too hot to handle, you're too hot to sleep. Menopause, perimenopause, other health conditions or even a mismatched bed partner with a different internal temperature can make you too hot to handle.\n\nTips for sleep hotties\n\nIf you're waking up drenched in sweat, or you're finding yourself frequently uncomfortable at night, check in with your doctor to see what underlying health condition may be at play. Medication side effects or hormonal changes can also influence how warm you feel at night, as the Calm post points out.\n\nBut if your bed partner is the culprit, follow this CNET tip and consider getting two separate blankets or comforters, which can also cut down on blanket tug-of-war.\n\n5. The 'light as a feather' sleeper\n\nLight sleepers wake up easily from noise, light or even a strong smell. If you're light as a feather, you might wake up in the morning after a solid seven or eight hours on the pillow still feeling unrested or sleepy.\n\nTips for those light as a feather\n\nIf you're restless and not getting the quality of sleep you want, consider sharpening your bedtime routine and adding a bit more structure -- including setting those bed boundaries, like not scrolling through social media or eating in your bed. (Loose crumbs itching your bare legs may be the last thing a light sleeper needs.)\n\nCalm and Harris also suggest reaching out to a sleep professional if you're concerned about the quality of your rest, screening for sleep conditions such as sleep talking, grinding teeth and sleep apnea.\n\nD3sign/Getty Images\n\nThe link between mental health and sleep\n\nHarris says she decided to partner with Calm in response to the current mental health crisis. The pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of anxiety, eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Mental health can be improved or harmed by someone's sleep patterns.\n\nSleep deprivation, in particular, can affect your ability to stay in control of your emotions or come up with solutions to seemingly not-so-complicated problems that can feel like the end of the world when you're sleep-deprived. (I asked Harris if there was any truth to my feeling like I regress to a child's ability to handle emotions when I'm sleep-deprived, and she explained that sleep deprivation disrupts the part of our mind responsible for reasoning and judgment, and our ability to toggle between states, or our cognitive flexibility.)\n\n\"With sleep deprivation in general, we find higher rates of anxiety, higher rates of depression, higher rates of stress,\" she said. \"And we find their stress tolerance and ability to cope with daily stressors becomes much more difficult.\"\n\nThe critical component is REM sleep, which you may be deficient in if you're regularly lacking sleep. This could lead to problems in your relationship or at work.\n\n\"REM sleep is really important for emotion processing, memories,\" Harris said. \"If you're waking up early or you're not getting enough REM sleep routinely, you're gonna have trouble with irritability, depression, anxiety, all that jazz.\"\n\nAnother bottom line on good sleep\n\nDespite the number of times we preach the health benefits of sleep, there's a thread in society that may be pushing back against the idea that healthy sleep trumps all. But according to Harris, \"No pun intended, you're living in a dream world a little bit,\" if you're trying to check off everything else on the wellness list before you start prioritizing sleep. Centering sleep will help you stabilize and prioritize all the other tasks you have during the day.\n\n\"We have to stop the hamster wheel somewhere, and if you stop it by prioritizing sleep, it makes the daytime run smoother.\""

            "headline": "How Beau Biden Set the Stage For Kamala Harris\u2019 Stunning Political Rise",
            "text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere were days the pair talked to each other more than they spoke to the people who slept under their roofs.\n\nKamala Harris was the state attorney general of California and Beau Biden was in the same role over in Delaware, where so many of the banks she was fighting were based. At the height of the clean-up from the 2008 financial crisis, more than a million California households caught up in the foreclosure wave were struggling to stay in their homes. For Harris to help any of them, she needed backup from Biden, who had oversight over Wilmington, Del., the banking industry's stealth capital. That partnership helped Harris emerge as one of the only political leaders in the country seen as holding bankers accountable for predatory practices.\n\nBeau Biden had Harris\u2019 flank until the end of his too-brief life, which ended in 2015 at age 46. Five years later, the man Beau called \u201cPop\u201d tapped Harris as his running mate, creating one of the most unlikely partnerships in Democratic politics. And when President Joe Biden decided to forgo the nomination this year and clear the way for Harris, it was the dividend on an accidental alliance forged in the early 2010s when two rising stars of the Democratic Party aligned and, to the point it\u2019s become canon, actually became sincere friends.\n\nBeau Biden was atop Harris\u2019 mind last month when she accepted the elder Biden\u2019s endorsement to be the next President. \u201cI first came to know President Biden through his son, Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe\u2019s leadership as President.\u201d\n\nTrite? Sure. But it has the benefit of also happening to be true.\n\nUp until Beau Biden\u2019s death, Joe Biden long believed his son had the potential to surpass his own impressive political career. So when the elder Biden tapped Harris four years ago this month, it was in no small measure based on her true friendship with the younger Biden. As I wrote at the time, one question hung over his deliberation more than any other: What Would Beau Do? That\u2019s how Biden got to yes on Harris, despite his primary rivalry with her and a skepticism that she actually believed in the vision for America she was pitching in her own White House run.\n\n\u201cI first met Kamala through my son Beau,\u201d Biden said during his roll-out of Harris. \u201cHe had enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one\u2019s opinion I valued more than Beau\u2019s, and I\u2019m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Joe Biden stood aside to give Harris her best shot to date at winning the top job in global politics. In ways great and small, it was a moment set up by Beau Biden, who in the aughts connected with his colleague in California and decided they\u2019d be great partners\u2014and, perhaps, the future of their shared Democratic Party. One succumbed to brain cancer and the other is currently leading Donald Trump in most national polls. What started as a check on banking overreach now stands to be the driving force behind Democratic politics. And, from the outside, it looks like a not entirely bad level of match-making.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter."

            "text": "After major police endorsement, Rep. Gallego faces backlash from progressive groups\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nAfter drawing praise for an endorsement by Arizona police, Rep. Ruben Gallego has now drawn anger and disappointment from some Arizona progressives for discouraging the Department of Justice from imposing federal oversight on the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department \u2014 sent one day after the Arizona Police Association announced it\u2019s backing Gallego in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race \u2014 the congressman said federal investigators \u201cmissed the mark\u201d in their examination of Phoenix police.\n\nThat nearly three-year investigation concluded in June that Phoenix police have engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of using excessive force, acting with bias and violating constitutional and civil rights.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn his letter, Gallego described those violations \u2013 \u201ca mere 120 or so unspecified incidents across eight years,\u201d he wrote \u2013 as isolated, not pervasive. And he argued against the need for federal oversight for the city\u2019s police department, a position aligned with some of the Phoenix City Council members, who\u2019ve resisted calls from community groups for the DOJ\u2019s further involvement.\n\nPhoenix police and city officials \u201calready welcome reforms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOversight, Gallego wrote, would be best left to local government.\n\n\n\nPolice back \u2018a freaking loser\u2019\n\nWhen it was announced Monday, the Arizona Police Association\u2019s endorsement was a coup for Gallego\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe APA describes itself as an umbrella organization \u2013 \u201can association of associations\u201d \u2013 that brings together various law enforcement entities from across the state. In doing so, they represent thousands of law enforcement officers in Arizona.\n\nThe week prior, APA President Justin Harris had joined Donald Trump onstage at a rally in Glendale to announce the organization\u2019s support of the former president \u2013 someone who Harris said could get our country \u201cback on track and make America great again.\u201d\n\nAlso onstage that day, Trump described Gallego as \u201ca freaking loser.\u201d\n\nDays later, the APA endorsed that \u201closer\u201d \u2013 \u201ca Marine combat veteran\u201d who \u201cunderstands the complexities of modern policing in American society today,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe APA does not take our endorsements lightly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe recognize the importance of having a U.S. senator that can bring people together to improve society for all. We believe Congressman Gallego will be that U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an endorsement that should come in handy as Gallego defends his record from the Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee, Kari Lake, who the APA endorsed for governor in 2022.\n\nWhile a Lake spokesperson accused Gallego of supporting the defunding of police, Harris praised the congressman for backing federal legislation to boost hiring and retention of police officers.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gallego has continually fought for robust, increased funding for America\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Just lost my vote\u2019\n\nGallego\u2019s letter stunned Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona.\n\n\u201cTo act as if (the DOJ\u2019s report) is in some way not accurately reflective of \u2013 detailing the significant problems with the Phoenix Police Department, is simply not true,\u201d Keenan said.\n\nThe timing of the letter, immediately following the endorsement of the state\u2019s largest independent law enforcement organization, made it worse, he said.\n\n\u201cIt seems very transactional,\u201d Keenan said.\n\n\u201cA lot of city officials and Rep. Gallego, they speak about public safety,\u201d he added. \u201cBut true public safety cannot ignore constitutional rights. It cannot ignore the violence perpetrated by the Phoenix Police Department on members of our community. And to issue statements like this is, frankly, dangerous, because it will embolden the police not to reform themselves.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Poder In Action, a community group that routinely lodges complaints about police treatment of Black, brown and Indigenous communities, called the claims in the letter \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to the communities Gallego represents in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is really just ridiculous to, after all of this evidence, to say that this department can change itself,\u201d executive director Viri Hernandez said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHernandez also said she wasn\u2019t shocked Gallego\u2019s letter came on the heels of the APA endorsement.\n\n\u201cOur community sees the way that police unions, when they support candidates, most of the time \u2014 every example we\u2019ve seen \u2014 also leads to those candidates pushing back against accountability, transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether the police endorsement was tied to the DOJ letter, a spokesperson for the Gallego campaign says there was \u201cno agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuben Gallego has a record of fighting for Arizona\u2019s law enforcement in Congress and is proud to have the support of the Arizona Police Association,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nPoder In Action isn\u2019t in the business of endorsing candidates. As a 501(c)3, they\u2019re barred from intervening in political campaigns. \u201cOur focus is to expose the discrepancies, the lies from any party \u2013 Democrats or Republicans,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell folks who to vote for, who to not vote for,\u201d she added.\n\nNeither does the ACLU of Arizona. But personally, Keenan didn\u2019t mince words when he first responded to the letter on X."

Read preview\n\nDonald Trump is worried about the use of AI in the forthcoming election.\n\nThe former president has called AI \"very dangerous\" and accused his opponent, Kamala Harris, of using it to exaggerate the size of one of her rally crowds.\n\n\"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?\" Trump said in a lengthy, capital-letter-strewn Truth Social post earlier this month.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\n\"There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d it,\" he wrote, adding: \"She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Trump's claim, the crowds shown in the image were genuine. An official from the Harris-Walz campaign told Business Insider that the photo had been taken by campaign staff and \"not modified by AI in any way.\"\n\nIn the weeks following his post accusing Harris of using AI, the former president went on to post several apparently AI-generated memes on Truth Social and X. The images depicted real-life figures, including Kamala Harris and Elon Musk.\n\nHe also reshared on Truth Social a set of dubious images of Taylor Swift and her fans with pro-Trump messaging. While two of the images appeared to show a genuine Trump supporter, others, including several images of women in \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirts, had telltale signs of being AI-generated.\n\nTrump later denied making the images himself and reflected on the use of AI more generally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're seeing it all the time,\" Trump said of AI-created content. \"It's a little bit dangerous out there.\"\n\nThe Swift photos had already attracted criticism online and made headlines. While that may have been exactly what Trump wanted, the former president's willingness to post what looks like AI-generated content without clear labels risks confusing some voters.\n\nViral misinformation\n\nExperts have long feared the widespread use of AI has the potential to affect elections around the world.\n\nDeepfakes, AI-generated text, and hyper-targeted ads can blur the line between fact and fiction, making it harder for voters to discern what is credible information. Bad actors can also use AI tools to purposely spread realistic disinformation on social media at an unprecedented scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublic literacy around AI-generated content also varies. While some people can easily identify fake content, others can be convinced by fake images or text.\n\n\"This content is also going viral before anybody has really fact-checked it,\" Eric Wengrowski, the CEO of Steg.AI, told Business Insider. \"It's also coming from a former president.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWengrowski said while it wasn't unethical for politicians to share AI-generated content for humorous or satirical reasons, public figures should ensure the content is labeled as AI.\n\n\"I do think it's unethical for politicians to be sharing AI-generated content if it is not clearly labeled with the appropriate watermark,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegal consequences\n\nThe legality of posting AI-generated images that use the likeness of public figures is also murky.\n\n\"It really depends on how the content is being presented,\" Brent Mittelstadt, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, said. \"If it's clearly being presented as a joke or as satire, then you're in a much stronger legal position.\"\n\n\"If something to a reasonable person would obviously be satire, then at a minimum, with things like copyright or usage of somebody's likeness, you can basically get around legal obligations in that way,\" he said.\n\nIn the case of the Swift-related content, Mittelstadt said it wasn't clear if the images were being presented as memes or satire. \"It's not to a reasonable person obviously fake, just from the content itself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for Trump did not respond to a request for comment from BI."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris Redefines \u2018American Exceptionalism\u2019 for a New Generation of Voters",
            "text": "Stengel is the former Editor of TIME, an MSNBC analyst and the author of Information Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation .\n\nIn the final moments of her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris said it was time \u201cto fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth.\u201d She then paused and said, \u201cthe privilege and pride of being an American.\u201d\n\nThat sentence is the most full-throated and sincere expression of American exceptionalism since the presidency of George W. Bush, and the most direct and unambiguous expression of that idea by a Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cI love our country with all my heart,\u201d she said a few seconds before, adding, \u201cWe are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nHard to say it more directly than that. That is in many ways the modern definition of American exceptionalism.\n\nThe idea of American exceptionalism has been mostly out of favor since it was seen as an underpinning of President Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. For Democrats, it has been a perilous concept for longer than that. American exceptionalism is the idea that the U.S., because of its unique history and origin, because of its founding documents, the Declaration and the Constitution, has a special role not only in the creation of modern democracy but in preserving it around the world. It\u2019s the idea that America is a moral beacon and has a providential role and responsibility to lead.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is a 20th century term, but the idea is older than the nation. Its inspiration comes from John Winthrop\u2019s famous 1630 sermon in which he said America \u201cshall be as a city upon a hill.\u201d It\u2019s a biblical reference that Ronald Reagan made famous and used hundreds of times in his political career. Reagan, who became the exemplar of exceptionalism, believed that Americans, as John Adams once said, were \u201cthe chosen people\u201d with a special destiny determined by the Almighty.\n\nBut the model of foreign policy exceptionalism comes from a different President: Woodrow Wilson. In trying to overcome American isolationism before World War I, it was Wilson who understood that he needed to appeal to American values\u2014the values of freedom, fairness, and equality, and an almost messianic sense of America\u2019s role in the world. This became known as foreign policy idealism, and every American President since Wilson has had to at least nod in that direction.\n\nFor the most part, American exceptionalists are, well, American. Foreigners tend to see the idea of American exceptionalism falling somewhere between naivet\u00e9 and narcissism. We are often regarded as hypocrites who tout our moral superiority while behaving in ways that are self-serving or damaging.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism became a campaign issue when Barack Obama was running for President in 2008. In an interview that year, Obama was asked whether he believed in American exceptionalism, and he replied, \u201cI believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.\u201d Well, let\u2019s just say that did not do the trick. In fact, his lukewarm embrace of the idea was seen as a rejection of American exceptionalism.\n\nI once heard Henry Kissinger say he thought Obama would be the first American President in his lifetime not to be an American exceptionalist. During the Republican primary in 2008, Mike Huckabee accused Obama of not being truly American, saying, \u201cTo deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation.\u201d The GOP turned the idea of exceptionalism into a political weapon. Their argument was, if you don\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism, you don\u2019t love this country and you don\u2019t deserve to lead it. Obama began to play defense and tried to embrace the idea of exceptionalism, as he said later that same year, \u201cOur exceptionalism must be based on our Constitution, our principles, our values, and our ideals.\u201d The subtext: It\u2019s not our size or military might that make us exceptional but our ideals, and the times we struggle to live up to those ideals, like the civil rights movement, are a part of that exceptionalism.\n\nRead More: How Kamala Harris Took \u2018Freedom\u2019 Back from the GOP\n\nHarris picks up where Obama left off but adds something new: Her\u2019s is a personal American exceptionalism, an exceptionalism seen through the prism of her own life and the immigrant experience. Her explanation of her own story suggests that what makes America exceptional is that it\u2019s a place where the child of an Indian immigrant mother and a Jamaican immigrant father can become the nominee for President.\n\nTraditionally, Americans of color were less enamored of the idea of American exceptionalism than white Americans. But recent data show that Americans of foreign and minority backgrounds have a higher degree of faith in America\u2019s promise than white Americans. A 2019 Cato Institute survey found that more immigrant citizens than native-born Americans are somewhat proud or very proud to be an American. A 2023 PRRI/Brookings survey found that more Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Black Americans than white Americans believe America\u2019s best days are ahead of us rather than behind us. And according to 2024 Pew Research Center polls, 75% of Indian Americans and 80% of Asian Americans\u2014higher percentages than white Americans\u2014say they have either achieved or are on their way to achieving the American Dream.\n\nHarris\u2019s embrace of American exceptionalism is a political twofer: It\u2019s a way to appeal both to some conservative voters who may have previously seen the Democratic Party as rejecting traditional red-white-and-blue patriotism and to the millions of legal immigrants who are indeed grateful for the privilege of being an American. In fact, the U.S. foreign-born population surpassed 46 million in 2022, the largest number in American history. That\u2019s almost 15% of the population, the greatest percentage of Americans with immigrant backgrounds since 1910. Naturalized American citizens constituted about 10% of the overall electorate in 2020, a record high. That percentage has only grown. That\u2019s a lot of voters, particularly in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada, which have hundreds of thousands of eligible immigrant voters.\n\nThe irony is that Donald Trump rejects the idea of American exceptionalism and is in fact an American declinist. He has said on numerous occasions that the American Dream is dead and that we are a failed nation. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan isn\u2019t an assertion of global leadership but rather a declaration of intent to withdraw and prioritize self-interest.\n\nThe first sentence of the 2016 platform of the Republican Party said, \u201cWe believe in American exceptionalism.\u201d Their nominee said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the term.\u201d And indeed he doesn\u2019t. When Trump was interviewed by Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News in 2017, O\u2019Reilly said \u201cPutin\u2019s a killer.\u201d Trump replied, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d He is a relativist about America, who doesn\u2019t think our values make us special but that the U.S. is just as morally compromised as other nations. The 2024 platform of the Republican Party doesn\u2019t mention \u201cexceptionalism.\u201d\n\nAuthoritarians don\u2019t like the idea of exceptionalism. Exceptionalism makes people feel special, it empowers them\u2014it promotes democracy. Just take it from Vladimir Putin, who wrote in a 2023 New York Times op-ed, \u201cIt is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.\u201d\n\nHarris used the term \u201cself-determination\u201d twice in her acceptance speech. Self-determination is the opposite of autocracy. It\u2019s a term that President Wilson referenced in his famous Fourteen Points speech that proposed the League of Nations, and it\u2019s a cardinal principle in international law. It is also a guiding principle of the immigrant\u2019s view of American exceptionalism, that here people can determine their own future. And that is who Harris was thinking of when she accepted the nomination. \u201cOn behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth,\u201d she said, \u201cI accept your nomination to be President of the United States.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Aug. 29\n\nThe original version of this story misidentified an American President in one instance. The author believes Kamala Harris has made the most \u201cfull-throated expression of American exceptionalism\u201d since the presidency of George W. Bush, not George H.W. Bush."

And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.\"\n\n'Next question, please,' Harris brushes off Trump's race comments\n\nHarris was asked to respond to former President Donald Trump's comments at the National Association of Black Journalists convention where he appeared to question Harris' race.\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said at the time.\n\nWhen asked about the comments by Bash, Harris responded, \"Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.\"\n\nThe CNN interview will air Thursday night at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris\u2019s Gamble",
            "text": "In the first month of Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s improbable run for President, she allowed Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm about finally having a credible opponent to Donald Trump to define her candidacy. Once Joe Biden left the race and Harris let her intentions be known, the excitement vastly outweighed the need to know precisely what policies she was running on. Tens of thousands of people joined Zoom calls to raise funds and created networks aimed at supporting the Vice-President\u2019s run. Thousands more stood in line for hours to pack arenas for rallies, which became staging grounds for crafting the themes of her developing campaign.\n\nAt those rallies, the framing of her campaign came into focus. Harris adhered to typical liberal fare: raising the minimum wage and providing affordable housing and health care. She has been more pointed in her intentions to fight for abortion rights and to extend protections and rights to L.G.B.T.Q. people. By choosing as her running mate the genuinely populist governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, over the more moderate Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, Harris delighted progressives.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nBut the most excitement about Harris\u2019s surprise candidacy has been generated without her having to say a word. Her presence at the top of the ticket, as a biracial woman and the daughter of two immigrant parents, has served as a backlash to the backlash against 2020\u2019s national reckoning with the history of American racism. Even as Harris and Walz have deftly avoided any mention of race or racism in this contest, its centrality to the looming election is undeniable.\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party\u2019s long campaign to end affirmative action was finally realized by a U.S. Supreme Court packed with Trump appointees. Books about slavery and racism against African Americans and school curricula teaching Black history have been banned in some states and localities. In Florida, in an effort that has since been challenged in court but which captured the national mood, Republican legislators passed the so-called Stop WOKE Act, which tried to manage the teaching of Black history based on whether it was perceived to make white students feel guilty. Universities in states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Utah have closed centers and offices dedicated to diversity.\n\nSince Harris became the presumptive nominee, Trump has attacked her racial identity, intentionally mispronounced her name, and questioned her intelligence, going so far as to call her \u201cdumb.\u201d His running mate, J. D. Vance, has supported a national ban on abortion and described people without children as inferior to parents. Under these circumstances, supporting Harris can feel like an act of resistance.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention provided Harris with the opportunity to spell out the specifics of why she should be promoted to President. It was organized to project a new image of Harris as tough and, as her husband, Doug Emhoff, put it, \u201cready to lead.\u201d Democrats seized the opportunity to claim they were charting a new course for the country, emphasizing themes of joy and patriotism; the crowd periodically broke out into chants of \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d Love of country was laced throughout the speeches, in contrast to Trump\u2019s regular descriptions of the U.S. as a hellscape that only he can rescue. As Michelle Obama intoned, Harris \u201ctruly understands\u201d what has \u201calways made America great.\u201d The emotive goals of the Convention seemed to have been met, but what of the opportunity to map out the meaning of a Harris Presidency?\n\nFor all the talk about moving forward, the Democratic Party decided to feature the parts of its past that most troubled its core constituencies of Black and young voters. Bill Clinton made his mark on the Party by championing a turn away from social welfare and civil rights. His legacy includes policies that fuelled mass incarceration and demonized poor Black people, especially Black women, whom he made the focal point of his efforts to abolish welfare as an entitlement. During her campaign for the Presidency in 2016, Hillary Clinton was hounded by Black Lives Matter activists for referring to juveniles in 1996 as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Barack Obama may be adored by many, but it was under his Administration that Occupy Wall Street and the Black Lives Matter movement erupted, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises of his historic run for office.\n\nThat the Party featured the old guard while still claiming a new path reflected the tensions throughout the Convention: joy alongside Harris\u2019s bellicose promise of pursuing American values abroad with \u201cthe strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\u201d; challenges to misogyny and promotion of different kinds of family, but no concrete details on how Harris would address the crisis in child-care costs and the rising costs of living. The Convention featured four of the wrongly convicted, and since exonerated, Central Park Five before a segment that celebrated Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor. Most pointedly, speakers repeatedly framed the election as a struggle for democracy and a fight for freedom, yet the D.N.C. refused to give a single Palestinian American any time on the main stage. The refusal was in contrast to the Convention\u2019s parade of Republicans, who were given speaking slots because they rejected Trump.\n\nThese conflicting messages seemed intended to inspire and embolden the base while also reaching voters who have not yet made up their minds. This dual purpose left Harris ill-equipped to speak about how she and her party plan to address the central issues of the election, including the hardships driven by economic inequality and inflation. Instead, she offered vague platitudes, promising an \u201copportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed.\u201d Harris pledged to \u201cend\u201d the housing shortage, with no details of how she would do it. There was almost no attempt to address the social questions that so sharply defined the 2020 race, when Harris was selected as Vice-President. Then, Harris decried \u201cstructural racism,\u201d injustice in our criminal-justice system, and \u201cexcessive use of force by police.\u201d In sum, she concluded, \u201cthere is no vaccine for racism. We\u2019ve gotta do the work.\u201d The new Democratic Party platform also featured this dramatic shift, burying the fight for racial justice of 2020. For the first time since 2012, the Party\u2019s platform does not oppose the death penalty; it calls for more police, without emphasizing police reform.\n\nTo be sure, much has changed since 2020. But Harris is gambling that the millions of people who marched in search of resolution to the crisis of racism that year will simply move forward on this well-trodden path to the future. The Democratic Party is gambling that the nomination of a Black and Indian woman alone will satisfy the desires for racial justice. It is a risky strategy. The G.O.P. is prepared to flood the airwaves with an assortment of comments that Harris has made that will validate the \u201cliberal\u201d label. As one G.O.P. strategist put it, \u201cThe archive is deep.\u201d In Harris\u2019s previous run for President, she supported universal health care and free tuition for students at public colleges and universities. She raised the possibility of \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She opposed fracking and called for an end to juvenile incarceration.\n\nEven though Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren are among the most popular Democrats in the country, and an unabashed strategy of leveraging public dollars to rebuild the U.S. economy and promising to address racial discrimination produced one of the largest voter turnouts in American history, Harris and the Party leadership have acquiesced to the terms of the Republican backlash and rejected anything having to do with the successful 2020 election. Instead of explaining why she has supported these positions, in hopes of persuading an electorate desperate for change and possibly open to her reasoning, Harris is trying to reinvent herself on the fly."

            "headline": "What I Heard at Swifties for Kamala",
            "text": "You might not be shocked to learn that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s favorite Taylor Swift song is about cosmic justice.\n\n\u201cI love \u2018Karma,\u2019\u201d the senator from Massachusetts said last night during a Zoom event for a group called Swifties for Kamala. \u201cAnd I have a thing or two to say about private equity!\u201d The 34,000 attendees probably would have cheered, but, as is typical for such a massive webinar, only the organizers had control of the microphone and camera. Warren was undaunted by the lack of response. \u201cIt is going to be a tough fight ahead,\u201d she said, winding up. \u201cThere are only 24 hours in a day\u2014or 144 \u2018All Too Well\u2019 10-minute versions.\u201d [Pause for no laughter.] \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, just like you\u2019ve done every time before, we will push this boulder up the hill.\u201d\n\nOnly a die-hard Swiftie would have caught all the references in Warren\u2019s words, which included a jab at the investment group backing Swift\u2019s nemesis, Scooter Braun, and a lyric from a Swift deep cut said to be about the singer\u2019s beef with Kim Kardashian. It seems safe to assume that Warren did not write all of these quips herself. But she would not be the only speaker on the call whose staffers had squeezed an unconscionable number of jokes into last night\u2019s remarks.\n\nRead: The Millennial cringe of Taylor Swift\n\nIdentity-based calls to action have been all the rage in this season of Democratic politics, with events like White Dudes for Harris and Win With Black Women drawing tens of thousands of attendees. Although America\u2019s Swifties are not an ethnic or racial group, they are arguably a religious one. Last night\u2019s call was an attempt to harness their unflagging devotion to the pop star and put it to political use.\n\nThe whole thing was, somehow, even cringier than I had anticipated\u2014and, as a Swiftie myself, I am familiar with the fandom\u2019s extreme dorkiness. The organizers looked startlingly young and inexperienced\u2014introducing lawmakers in shaky voices, clearly nervous to be blindly addressing thousands of viewers. They passed the mic too often, rambled, and misspoke. And the middle-aged politicians were working painfully hard to demonstrate fluency in the dialect of Swiftworld.\n\nStill, the cringe seemed, at least partly, the point. Like the broader Harris campaign, these organizers leaned into the awk. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about how joy isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d Irene Kim, a Swifties for Kamala co-founder and its executive director, said on the call, citing a recent New York Times op-ed. \u201cBut that definitely hasn\u2019t been our experience!\u201d\n\nThe project began with a post by a 22-year-old named Emerald Medrano, who runs a popular Swift fan account. \u201cI feel like us U.S. swifties should mass organize and help campaign for Kamala Harris,\u201d he wrote on X in July. Soon, Swifties for Kamala was born: a partnership of fans, some of whom run social-media accounts and others who have experience in Democratic politics. A month later, the group has 71,000 followers on X, a Substack newsletter, and a Discord channel.\n\nThe organizers seem to assume that Swift, who backed Joe Biden in 2020, will support the Democratic nominee. But Swift has not actually endorsed anyone yet, a fact that went unacknowledged in last night\u2019s call. Her support in the race is highly sought after; last week, Donald Trump shared tacky AI deepfakes to claim he had the pop star\u2019s backing. During the Democratic National Convention, rumors swirled of a surprise musical performance: Would it be Taylor? (No.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping things political, but also everything has a layer of Swiftiness to it,\u201d Annie Wu Henry, the campaign manager at Swifties for Kamala, who has also worked for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive lawmakers, said during last night\u2019s call. Organizers wore Swift-themed cardigans and displayed glittery #47s on their hands, in reference to what could be Harris\u2019s place in the presidential timeline. They encouraged viewers in the Zoom chat to chip in either $13 or $19.89\u2014both important Swiftian numbers\u2014and, like Taylor, they frequently folded their hands into hearts for the camera.\n\nRead: Taylor Swift\u2019s post-Reputation approach to politics\n\nThe Zoom event was light on policy talk, heavy on allusion. After Warren spoke, Representative Becca Balint of Vermont offered a pep talk: \u201cThe MAGA movement will be defeated by our dominoes, cascading in a line!\u201d she said, quoting the song \u201cMastermind.\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York read off a few jokes. \u201cKarma is a relaxing thought, but for Donald Trump it\u2019s not\u2014facts!\u201d she said, to the ever-silent audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re in line to vote, stay, stay, stay!\u201d When Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts showed up, he revealed that his favorite Swift song is, oddly, \u201cSnow on the Beach\u201d\u2014because it highlights the risks of global warming. \u201cClimate change is threatening our favorite phenomenon,\u201d the senator said, before adding that the waters outside Swift\u2019s beach house in Rhode Island are \u201csome of the fastest-warming \u2026 in the world!\u201d\n\nJust like a Taylor Swift marketing campaign, the Zoom call promised surprises and exciting guests. There would be a big announcement at 8 p.m., organizers teased, and a very special person would wrap up the call at about 8:30 p.m. One special speaker was the singer-songwriter Carole King, now in her 80s, who materialized like a yellow-haired fairy godmother. King, who called Swift her \u201cmusical and songwriting granddaughter,\u201d sang part of the chorus from \u201cShake It Off,\u201d and offered advice to first-time campaign volunteers: \u201cThe key to door-knocking is asking a good question and then listening.\u201d She urged Swifties to ask voters what they might find in common with Harris. \u201cYou\u2019re building a bridge to that person,\u201d King said\u2014aware, apparently, of how much Swifties appreciate bridges.\n\nAt 8 o\u2019clock, the big announcement was made: Merch drop! Swiftie T-shirts and tote bags reading In My Voting Era were for sale\u2014no affiliation, organizers carefully reminded fans, with Swift herself.\n\nNearly two hours into the call, the surprise final guest\u2014Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a rising Democratic star\u2014still hadn\u2019t appeared. The leaders of Swifties for Kamala began signing off. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed, and so happy and fully immersed in Swiftie-ism right now,\u201d Medrano said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to paint the town blue, and it\u2019s going to be the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened in this country!\u201d\n\nThe letdown didn\u2019t kill their enthusiasm\u2014with Swifties, it never does. The group had raised money at a clip that the capitalist icon herself would have been proud of: The night\u2019s fundraising haul totaled an auspicious $122,000. If Harris is hoping that joy and\u2014yes\u2014cringe can help her win the White House, she\u2019s got the right fandom on her side."

            "headline": "Seven Questions That Should Be Easy for Harris to Answer",
            "text": "A presidential nominee normally accounts for their past actions in public life and clarifies their plans for the future. This year, Kamala Harris ran in no primaries, and since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not had a formal press conference where she would be expected to answer questions from reporters. She has not sat down for an in-depth interview on television or with a major paper such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. (CNN recently announced that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will be interviewed by one of the network\u2019s anchors this week.) This avoidance may be a strategy to keep the \u201cgood vibes\u201d of her campaign going, but it does a disservice to voters and bodes poorly for how transparent and forthcoming Harris would be if she wins the presidency.\n\nBefore Harris was vice president or a U.S. senator, she spent roughly a quarter century in the criminal-justice system\u2013\u2013she was California\u2019s attorney general, San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, and a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, a job she took shortly after graduating from law school. Her work as a prosecutor constitutes the bulk of her career. She wrote a 2009 book, Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor\u2019s Plan to Make Us Safer, laying out her policy views. And she has talked a lot about criminal-justice issues in her years as a national politician.\n\nYet even her positions on important criminal-justice issues remain unclear, because of inconsistencies in her actions and statements and failures to address tough questions posed by critics of her record.\n\nRead: The prosecutor vs. the felon\n\nI sent the Harris campaign questions that voters deserve to have answered: about her record as a \u201ctop cop,\u201d about apparent changes in her rhetoric and positions, and about what policies she would pursue if elected. At the time of publication, her campaign hasn\u2019t provided any answers, but should that change, this story will be updated. Here are some of the questions I asked, edited for clarity and concision:\n\nDaniel Larsen, an unsympathetic defendant, was convicted of felony possession of a knife in 1999 after police testified that they saw him throw the weapon under a car in a Los Angeles parking lot. He got 28 years in prison. But as it turned out, a witness\u2013\u2013James McNutt, a retired Army sergeant first class and former police chief\u2013\u2013had been in the parking lot that night with his wife; both gave sworn statements that they saw a different man, William Hewitt, throw the knife under the car. Hewitt swore that\u2019s what happened too. So did Hewitt\u2019s girlfriend. Yet at trial, Larsen\u2019s attorney failed to identify or call any of those witnesses; he also failed to request that the knife be examined for fingerprints or to argue that it belonged to someone else. He was later disbarred for failing other clients.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, just before you became attorney general of California, Judge Suzanne H. Segal ruled that Larsen\u2019s case was one of those \u201cextraordinary cases where the petitioner asserts his innocence and establishes that the court cannot have confidence in the contrary finding of guilt.\u201d She declared that \u201cno reasonable juror would have found Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that he \u201cclearly received ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d The state was ordered to retry the case or release Larsen.\n\n\n\nBut while you were attorney general, your office filed an appeal attempting to block Larsen\u2019s release, because he hadn\u2019t filed his claim for relief in a timely manner. In other words, your office sought to keep a man in prison on procedural grounds, despite strong evidence of his innocence. As a result, Larsen spent two more years in prison, until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he had cleared the threshold for producing proof of innocence. Even then, your office continued to litigate the matter, arguing before a three-judge panel that \u201cone reasonable juror could still vote to convict.\u201d When that failed, forcing the prisoner\u2019s release, your office worked to prevent Larsen from receiving funds earmarked for people who are wrongly convicted of crimes.\n\n\n\nWhy did your office work so hard to keep a man in prison after it was clear that he didn\u2019t commit the crime that put him there?\n\nIn 2010, when you were San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, a scandal rocked the crime lab run by the San Francisco Police Department. A technician who analyzed drugs was deemed \u201cincreasingly UNDEPENDABLE for testimony\u201d by an assistant DA, a co-worker observed that the area where she tested drugs was in \u201cdisarray,\u201d an audit found missing evidence, and the technician\u2019s sister reported that she had a vial of cocaine at her house. She ultimately acknowledged taking evidence home for personal use. Her behavior raised the prospect of unreliable analysis and testimony in hundreds of cases. But neither you nor your office notified defense attorneys in potentially affected cases.\n\n\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported on a judicial rebuke you received, writing that the judge \u201cconcluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys\u201d about problems in the crime lab, violating the rights of defendants. At the time, you defended your behavior and criticized the judge as biased. Later, while you were running for president in 2020, The Washington Post asked about the matter, and reported that you \u201ctook responsibility for the failings,\u201d including your failure to develop a written policy so that your office \u201cwould notify defendants about problems with witnesses and evidence.\u201d You told the Post, \u201cNo excuses. The buck stops with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the future, if a federal prosecutor is found to violate a defendant\u2019s rights, what consequences should he or she face?\n\nIn Smart on Crime, you championed putting more police officers on the street, arguing that it would mean faster responses to assaults and robberies and fewer quality-of-life crimes. \u201cVirtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see police officers walking a beat,\u201d you wrote. \u201cThis is as true in economically poor neighborhoods as wealthy ones.\u201d But in a June 2020 radio interview, you said, \u201cIt is old thinking, it is outdated, and is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.\u201d That same month, appearing on The View, you said: \u201cIn many cities in America, over one-third of their city budget goes to police \u2026 What are we doing? What about the money going to social services? What about the money going to helping people with job training? What about helping with the mental-health issues that communities are being plagued with?\u201d\n\n\n\nDid something cause you to change your position in the years after you published your book? If so, what? Do you still believe that cities should pay to put more police officers on the street?\n\nWhen you were attorney general of California, the ACLU faulted you for failing to protect the privacy of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cOn your watch as California\u2019s top cop, law enforcement agencies up and down the state have been secretly using social media surveillance software that has been marketed to monitor protests and activists of color,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHighly invasive facial recognition that may have a disproportionate impact on Californians of color is also being quietly used in several of our largest cities and counties. As the Attorney General, your leadership is urgently needed to address the lack of transparency, accountability, and oversight of law enforcement surveillance technology in order to fulfill your duty to safeguard the privacy, free speech, and civil rights of Californians.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat, if anything, did you do in response to that letter? And how does that response reflect your position on how transparent the government should be about the surveillance technologies that it uses?\n\nAs attorney general of California, you were criticized for taking a hands-off approach to credible abuse allegations against local prosecutors and police. \u201cHarris sent an unmistakable signal,\u201d the investigative reporter R. Scott Moxley wrote in a scathing 2019 OC Weekly article. \u201cUnder her watch, police-agency employees in California were free to commit perjury\u2014even in death-penalty cases, as they did in Orange County.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter multiple Oakland police officers were accused of having sex with an underage girl, \u201ccivil rights lawyers and California residents had been pleading for then-Attorney General Kamala Harris to open an independent investigation into the situation, since it spanned several police departments and involved allegations of coverups,\u201d Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote in Reason magazine. \u201cBut she never responded to the petitions and pleas asking her to look into systemic sexual exploitation by state agents in Oakland.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Campos, a former San Francisco supervisor and police commissioner and a vice chair of the California Democratic Party, told The New York Times, \u201cWe never thought we had an ally in the district attorney \u2026 When she had the opportunity to do something about police accountability, she was either not visible, or when she was, she was on the wrong side.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow would you answer critics who say that you did too little to police the police, and if elected president, what approach would you take to federal oversight of law enforcement?\n\nDavid Daleiden is an anti-abortion activist. In 2015, he pretended to be a representative of a fetal-tissue-procurement company and met with Planned Parenthood, and later released surreptitiously taken videos to show those staffers discussing the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the videos were misleadingly edited. On July 31, 2015, the National Abortion Federation filed a lawsuit claiming that Daleiden violated privacy laws when taking the videos. As AG, you opened a criminal investigation. Daleiden was indicted by your successor. In a lawsuit, Daleiden says that he was targeted for prosecution because Planned Parenthood is an ideological ally that has given you campaign contributions.\n\n\n\nUndercover videos are sometimes used by journalists and activists on the right and the left. The people taking the videos argue that doing so is in the public interest and that they are exposing misconduct. Do you favor or oppose laws that make it unlawful for journalists and activists to surreptitiously capture video and release it to the public? How do you propose ensuring that such laws are enforced in an evenhanded manner?\n\nAs San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, you prosecuted parents for their children\u2019s habitual failure to attend school. Do you think district attorneys nationwide should pursue similar policies or that the risks of overly harsh enforcement are too high?\n\nRead: Why Kamala Harris\u2019s politics are so hard to pin down\n\nCandidates aren\u2019t informed about every issue. Sometimes, a reasonable answer is \u201cI have to think about that and get back to you.\u201d But Harris is well versed in all of these issues, having pondered them for years. Voters deserve to know where she stands on them today."

            "headline": "U.S. Army Confirms Trump Staffer \u2018Pushed\u2019 Arlington Staffer Before Filming TikTok Ad",
            "text": "Donald Trump is facing new questions on Thursday about a stunt the former president filmed at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week. Photos of the 45th president giving a big thumbs up were the first to surface in an incredibly tacky, if typical, move for Trump. But new revelations from that day have been trickling out, including allegations of a physical altercation between Trump\u2019s staff and a staff member at Arlington, as well as the fact that Trump likely broke federal law while filming the ad at the cemetery.\n\nIt all started Monday when Trump appeared at Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony wreath for 13 U.S. military service members killed at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan during the American withdrawal in 2021. Federal regulations prohibit the filming of campaign commercials and the production of publicity material, but Trump brought along a crew to document his little stunt.\n\nAs the New York Times points out, Trump was in a heavily restricted part of the cemetery known as Section 60, which is primarily for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a staff member at Arlington approached his camera crew. There was a physical altercation, with Trump\u2019s staff insisting they should be allowed to film in the restricted area for their stupid little commercial.\n\nThe Arlington staff member has reportedly declined to press charges against Trump because it \u201ccould subject her to retaliation from Trump supporters,\u201d as the Times reports. And that\u2019s a reasonable fear, given the fact that Trump is the guy who tried to literally overthrow the U.S. government on January 6, 2021, and his followers are some of the most violent extremists around.\n\nThe Trump camp has tried to play down the incident and campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even slandered the Arlington staff member as mentally unstable on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump\u2019s team during a very solemn ceremony,\u201d Cheung told NPR.\n\nCheung added to NPR, \u201cWe are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made.\u201d But no footage showing details of the physical altercation has been released yet and NPR writes that when a reporter asked to see the footage, the Trump campaign declined.\n\nThe Army released a new statement about the incident on Thursday to defend the unnamed staff member at Arlington (ANC), who was simply trying to enforce the rules.\n\n\u201cParticipants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\u201d an unnamed Army spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation\u2019s fallen deserve,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe Trump campaign has released several staged videos from that day, and Trump himself says in one of the videos he\u2019s churned out for social media that, \u201cWe lost 13 people great, great people, what a horrible day it was,\u201d referring to the last day U.S. forces were officially in Afghanistan under wartime conditions. And then Trump insisted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose one person in 18 months and then they took over that disaster of leaving Afghanistan.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true, of course. The Associated Press fact-checked his claim back in 2022 and reported there was no 18-month period during his presidency without casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nBut all of that is really beside the point. Trump clearly broke the law by trying this idiotic move at a place widely revered as a site of quiet contemplation. As he does with everything, Trump turned it into a circus all about himself.\n\nThe law Trump broke by filming at the cemetery is 32 CFR \u00a7 553.32, according to the Washington Post, which prohibits any politician from engaging in political activity at the site. The newspaper talked with legal experts who emphatically explained that \u201cif the campaign was filming during the wreath-laying ceremony for partisan political activities, that would be a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nTrump is struggling in the national polls, as he and Kamala Harris have just a little over two months before Election Day. And it\u2019s clear that Trump will do anything he can\u2014including breaking federal law\u2014in a desperate bid to retake power. With any luck, the former president will fail in those efforts. But things could get a lot weirder before they get any better on November 8."

Read preview\n\nAs a retirement tsunami looms in the US, life after work is top of mind for many. And some Americans worry they'll survive longer than Social Security.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies released its 2024 retirement outlook for the middle class. It delved into the financial concerns and retirement preparations for those with annual household incomes of $50,000 to $199,999 using a sample of just over 10,000 people \u2014 about 5,000 of whom fell into the middle-class category.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs it turns out, middle-class workers have plenty of worries about retirement. Their greatest fear is outliving their savings and investments.\n\nAmong those with household incomes of $50,000 to $99,000 and those with incomes of $100,000 to $199,000, 40% of both groups said that sticking around longer than their nest eggs was one of their greatest fears in retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat comes as middle-class Americans expect to live to a median age of 90, over a decade more than the US's current life expectancy of 77.5. Americans aged 65, which is about the average retirement age, can expect to live an average of 18.4 more years \u2014 a significant amount of time to rely on savings or Social Security.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that middle-class Americans are worried about the future of Social Security, which often fills the gap between retirees' savings and their financial needs. Broadly, 39% of those in the middle-class cohort said that one of their greatest fears in retirement was that Social Security would be reduced \u2014 or simply cease to exist \u2014 in the future.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe uncertain future of Social Security has long had older generations concerned. According to the latest Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees report, the program will only be able to pay out full benefits for the next 11 years \u2014 meaning that after that point, benefits will dwindle if Congress does not step in.\n\nThat's particularly troubling for Americans who have relied primarily on Social Security benefits to stay afloat financially in retirement. In a recent NerdWallet study of 2,100 adults, just 30% of respondents said they believe Social Security alone will allow them to live comfortably in retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne 63-year-old previously told Business Insider that she's \"incredibly scared\" Social Security won't be enough to cover her expenses. \"I think I'll probably need to work until I die because there's no money,\" she said.\n\nThe report also found that worries about Social Security are a primary reason some middle-class people plan to work after retirement. Of the 52% who plan to work after they retire, 55% plan to do so because of the extra income, while 33% are concerned Social Security benefits will be lower than expected.\n\nWith the presidential election quickly approaching, the fate of Social Security and Medicare is a hot-button issue for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. While Trump has vowed to protect benefits for older Americans, Democrats have accused the GOP of threatening to cut the benefits and raise the retirement age. The issue is likely to get more heated as November gets closer.\n\nAre you worried about outliving your retirement savings?

            "headline": "The Tech-Trump Alliance",
            "text": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nSome of the most prominent figures in Silicon Valley are enthusiastically supporting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. And Trump\u2019s running mate, J. D. Vance, is a former venture capitalist with deep ties to the right-wing tech billionaire Peter Thiel; as my colleague Ali Breland put it in a recent article, Silicon Valley \u201cgot their guy.\u201d I spoke with Ali, who covers tech and right-wing politics, about the long-simmering ideas animating Silicon Valley\u2019s shift to the right.\n\nReturning to Their Roots\n\nLora Kelley: Many people think of the Silicon Valley tech scene as a pretty liberal one. Is that assumption true? And if so, how did we get to this point where some of the most visible leaders in tech are backing Trump?\n\nAli Breland: There is a shift happening. I don\u2019t want to discount that. But this, to me, is also indicative of some segments of Silicon Valley returning to their roots.\n\nIf you look back at some of the original literature that was coming out of the tech scene\u2014the early issues of Wired magazine, or the Whole Earth Catalog\u2014they featured not necessarily hard-right ideologies but these free-market, libertarian ideologies. This kind of stuff was always flowing through Silicon Valley, even when tech executives were voting for and supporting Democrats. A lot of tech companies\u2019 business models involve finding ways to circumvent regulation and then hiring workforces that are not on staff or are extremely difficult to unionize.\n\nThe tech industry supported Democrats such as Barack Obama in part because he allowed that culture to exist within his version of liberalism. Tech titans perceive Kamala Harris and Joe Biden to be chipping away at that flexibility, so they\u2019re turning to a right that they see as more friendly to tech.\n\nLora: Is the selection of Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate hastening this turn?\n\nAli: Elon Musk was very excited when Trump picked Vance; he posted on X that the ticket \u201cresounds with victory.\u201d Some tech people seem to be feeling: He\u2019s one of us. He\u2019s connected to Peter Thiel. He worked out here. He believes in what we believe. There are certainly people coalescing around the campaign because of that.\n\nVance is where he is in large part because of Thiel\u2019s $15 million donation to his Senate campaign. Even though Thiel has said he isn\u2019t donating this cycle, the 2021 campaigns of Vance and Blake Masters were a warm-up moment. Venture capitalists were giving many millions more to the right than to Democrats in that cycle.\n\nLora: How pervasive is the support for Trump in Silicon Valley? Is the entire sector shifting? Or is it more that a few loud voices are getting lots of attention?\n\nAli: There are different factions. A lot of tech workers still skew left, or believe in a liberal version of the free market. And a lot of the tech-titan set are still Democrats: There\u2019s Aaron Levie of the software company Box; Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, is the mega Democratic donor of Silicon Valley; Sheryl Sandberg has publicly supported Kamala Harris.\n\nBut we are also seeing a group of right-backing tech titans expressing a new rhetoric that didn\u2019t have a place in Silicon Valley before. Thiel, for example, has been pushing his far-right beliefs into the ether for a long time. At one point, he was treated as an oddity. Now he\u2019s in step with the prevailing ideological movement among tech billionaires.\n\nLora: What are some of the ideas animating this new rhetoric?\n\nAli: In the techno-optimist manifesto that Marc Andreessen released last fall, he cites Nick Land, a British philosopher who became important in the intellectual development of the far right. He also cites F. T. Marinetti, who was an Italian futurist and fascist. And he quotes Friedrich Nietzsche, who is not inherently right-wing, but who is having a moment among this set of right-wing advocates of eugenics and a \u201cnatural order\u201d who want to see \u201cstrongmen\u201d take over, and who see feminists and the DEI movement as getting in the way of the country\u2019s true potential. I don\u2019t know if Andreessen believes in all of that. But that appeal to the strongman is indicative of the new right-wing thinking that\u2019s taking shape in Silicon Valley.\n\nLora: Some of this seems to be about ideology and values. But what are some of the more immediate policy concerns that are pushing tech titans toward the right?\n\nAli: A lot of tech leaders want to be left alone and unregulated. And there\u2019s lately been a shift in how the industry perceives Democrats to be approaching tech. Biden\u2019s appointment of Lina Khan, a proponent of stringent antitrust law, to lead the Federal Trade Commission is something tech people bring up a lot, and cite as an example of Biden not being interested in helping the industry. Even Andreessen has suggested that he misses the old Democrats who gave tech this cozy place and let them do what they want.\n\nThere is also a large crypto contingent that sees Biden as aggressively anti-crypto, and they\u2019re very skeptical of his appointment of Gary Gensler as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They\u2019re a bit more cautiously optimistic about Harris. But they still see Trump as the clearest path toward a low-regulation environment that\u2019s good for them.\n\nClearly, there is an aesthetic sensibility that crypto people appreciate about Trump, too. There\u2019s a troll-y aspect, and both Trump\u2019s MAGA base and the crypto community have ties to 4chan. Still, in past election cycles, crypto communities were not broadly pro-Trump, because there was no clear edge for them and their own material interests. Now some tech leaders see Trump as a way to satisfy those interests.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday\u2019s News\n\nThe U.S. Army said that an Arlington National Cemetery employee, who tried to ensure that Donald Trump\u2019s team adhered to the cemetery\u2019s rules against political activity during his recent visit, was \u201cabruptly pushed aside.\u201d An interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will air tonight on CNN. They answered questions about their plans for the White House, why Harris changed her position on decriminalizing illegal border crossings, and Trump\u2019s attacks on her racial identity.

Jetzt deutete er einen Sexskandal an.\n\nDonald Trump versucht weiter, mit derben Kommentaren die Aufmerksamkeit im US-Wahlkampf auf sich zu ziehen. Auf der von ihm mitbegr\u00fcndeten Plattform \"Truth Social\" waren Andeutungen zu lesen, wonach sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten die politische Karriere von Kamala Harris bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten.\n\nAnspielungen auf Sex-Skandal von Bill Clinton\n\nIn dem Post des republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Harris zu sehen, auf dem sie neben der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton steht. Dazu der Kommentar: \"Lustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben ...\"\n\nDie Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sexskandal, in den Clintons Mann und Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 bis 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Die Andeutungen sind in dem Post nicht mit Quellen belegt, werden aber dennoch von Trump-Anh\u00e4ngern geteilt.\n\nTrump verfasste den Beitrag nicht selbst. Dass er ihn auf seinem offiziellen Truth-Social-Account verbreitete, ist dennoch bemerkenswert. Der Republikaner verunglimpft seine demokratische Gegnerin im Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Unter anderem bezeichnet er sie als \"verr\u00fcckt\" und \"dumm\".\n\nTrump hat Harris auch schon mit Blick auf ihre Hautfarbe und Herkunft attackiert und unter anderem behauptet, die 59-J\u00e4hrige sei \"vor einigen Jahren pl\u00f6tzlich schwarz\" geworden. Verbale Angriffe sexueller Art haben eine neue Qualit\u00e4t.\n\nBei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Chicago kommentierte Trump die Hautfarbe von Kamala Harris.\n\nImmer wieder pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe - trotz Mahnungen\n\nMehrere Republikaner hatten Trump zuletzt \u00f6ffentlich dazu geraten, weniger pers\u00f6nliche Attacken gegen Harris von sich zu geben, sondern mehr inhaltliche Punkte zu machen. Trump wurde k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Pressekonferenz auf diese Mahnungen angesprochen, tat solche Ratschl\u00e4ge jedoch ab.\n\n\"Ich glaube, ich habe ein Recht darauf, sie pers\u00f6nlich zu attackieren\", sagte der 78-J\u00e4hrige mit Blick auf Harris und den Wahlkampf und schob nach: \"Ich muss es auf meine Art machen.\"\n\nSchon im Wahlkampf 2016 hatte Trump mit einer vulg\u00e4ren Aussage f\u00fcr Furore gesorgt, dass er Frauen \u00fcberall anfassen k\u00f6nne, auch zwischen den Beinen. Die Amerikaner w\u00e4hlten ihn damals trotzdem zum Pr\u00e4sidenten."

In court papers, Special Counsel Jack Smith said this latest action was an effort to respect and implement the Supreme Court holdings. The new charges specify when prosecutors think Trump was acting as a candidate seeking political office and not as the President. If he wins the election in November, Trump could order the Justice Department to dismiss the case. If he loses, Johnson says all the legal wrangling could get even more intense.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo members of Trump\u2019s campaign staff had a verbal and physical altercation with an official at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday while Trump was attending a ceremony honoring 13 troops killed in Afghanistan in 2021.

You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.\n\nEarlier this year, Donald Trump's social media company was worth something like $9 billion.\n\nBut that was then, and its stock has been sinking since: Now investors think Trump Media & Technology Group Corp \u2014 the company that runs Truth Social, Trump's Twitter clone \u2014 is worth a mere $4 billion. Today its stock closed at just above $20 a share, the lowest it has been since the company had its equivalent of an IPO in March.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nTo start, a caveat we've mentioned before: DJT is a meme stock. Investors aren't valuing it based on the company's financials, which are very meager at best. They think it's worth something because other people think it's worth something, and that collective fantasy will work right up until it doesn't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo trying to figure out why DJT is moving up or down on any given day isn't likely to lead to a satisfactory answer. Mostly you're going to get something along these lines: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nStill. We can at least acknowledge that DJT has been sliding for quite some time. So there's something going on.\n\nOne reason Trump's stock may be moving down is that lots of people who own Trump stock are Trump fans, and/or people betting that Trump will win the November election. But it has been harder to be in one of those groups recently: Since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden as Trump's opponent, Trump has been losing ground in the polls, and now both The New York Times and pollster Nate Silver see him as a slight underdog.\n\nSo if DJT is a proxy for Trump's election chances, it would make sense that it has been limping recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other very plausible reason that Trump stock is moving down is that investors may be worried about Trump selling some of his shares in the company. This could lead to other investors selling, which would have a cascading effect on the share price.\n\nTrump currently owns about 60% of Truth Social, which means his stake is worth about $2.4 billion. He's been restricted from selling any shares because of a lock-up restriction, which are common in public offerings. But the lock-up period could end as soon as September 20 \u2014 hence people trying to get out of the stock before he does.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere are two arguments against that theory, by the way: The first is that the lock-up period has been public knowledge since Truth Social first went public, so why bail now? The second is that Trump knows that if he does sell stock \u2014 and particularly if he sells a lot of stock \u2014 that the stock will really collapse. Because all but the most die-hard Trump fans will see it as the end of the company.\n\nSo there's a real tension there: Does Trump keep his theoretical $2.4 billion stake intact? Or does he try to turn it into actual money, and risk making the overall value much less?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any case, it's possible that both of the ideas above \u2014 Trump's declining political fortune, and the idea that he may be ready to trigger a big sell-off himself \u2014 are true. Or maybe there's something else at work that we have yet to see.\n\nThe only thing we know for certain is that if you bought Trump stock in late March and haven't sold it since then, you are down by more than 50%. We don't give investment advice around here. But don't say we didn't warn you."

            "text": "From the Gaza war to immigration to inflation, Harris is yet to spell out how she will accomplish her agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris will sit down for her first major broadcast interview since she became the face of the Democratic Party following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nShe will be joined by her running mate, Tim Walz, for the interview with CNN.\n\nUntil now, Harris has taken a cautious approach towards the press, much like Biden, who has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than any of the past seven US presidents, Axios reported, citing presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar.\n\nHarris\u2019s own sparse engagement with the media has come under scrutiny, especially from the Republicans. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to do a news conference; she\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Republican challenger Donald Trump said during a news conference of his own on August 15.\n\nTo be sure, Harris has spoken on several key issues that polls suggest matter to American voters, in campaign rallies and policy speeches. But without the cross-questioning that an interview allows, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee\u2019s positions on critical subjects remain ambiguous.\n\nSo when is the interview and what are some of the questions Harris has yet to clearly answer?\n\nWhen is Harris\u2019s CNN interview?\n\nHarris will speak to CNN\u2019s anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash alongside the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, at 9pm (01:00 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t be silent\u2019 on Gaza: How will she speak up?\n\nOn July 26, following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, Harris pledged not to stay silent on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,\u201d she told reporters. Yet, simultaneously, she pledged unwavering commitment to Israel.\n\n''I have had an unwavering commitment to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel.'' US VP Kamala Harris says she expressed her 'serious concerns' to Israeli PM Netanyahu about the 'scale of human suffering in Gaza.' pic.twitter.com/1U0KErqiDL \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 26, 2024\n\nIn the month since she made this statement, however, Harris\u2019s relative silence on Gaza has come under fire from critics who have questioned whether Harris\u2019s policy on Israel\u2019s war will be any different from Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo far, the answer, many believe, seems to be a firm no.\n\nAmid speculation that she might at least consider using restrictions on arms sales to Israel as leverage to convince the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop massacres of Palestinians, her adviser on national security made clear that Harris had no such plans.\n\n\u201cShe does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\u201d Phil Gordon, the adviser, said on August 8.\n\n.@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law. \u2014 Phil Gordon (@PhilGordon46) August 8, 2024\n\nAt this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which was held from August 19 to August 22 in Chicago, Harris once again simultaneously pledged support for Israel and expressed sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the Democrats refused to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the convention, while the parents of an Israeli-American captive held in Gaza were allowed to take the stage.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters rallied outside the DNC venue on all three days but were blocked from marching too close to the venue by police. Many warned that they would not support Harris in the November vote unless she ends unconditional support for Israel.\n\nHow will she ban \u2018price gouging\u2019?\n\nOn August 16, Harris proposed a ban on \u201cprice gouging\u201d by food suppliers and grocery stores.\n\nPrice gouging refers to dramatically raising prices to \u201cunfair levels\u201d in response to short-term high demand or scarcity \u2013 often following disasters, such as flooding. While several states already restrict the practice for some goods considered essential, there is no federal law barring it.\n\nThe proposal could be popular. High grocery bill inflation is a key concern for many voters. Under Biden\u2019s administration, grocery prices have gone up by 21 percent as part of an inflation surge.\n\nBut Harris has not spelt out how exactly she would go about enacting this ban on price gouging, earning her backlash from political critics, as well as industry.\n\nIn a release last week, the Trump campaign called her plan an example of \u201ccommunist price controls\u201d.\n\nIndustrialists and economists also said the plan could do more harm than good.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan is vague, but a central part of it involves getting the US Congress to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging in food and grocery sectors, similar to legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last year.\n\nYet political analysts point out that such legislation has almost no chance of passing in Congress \u2014 raising questions about the sincerity of Harris\u2019s proposal.\n\nWill she build a border wall?\n\nHarris has flip-flopped on the topic of immigration.\n\nDuring the DNC, she pledged that she would sign the now-defunct bipartisan border security bill that Trump wanted to terminate out of fears that it would benefit Democrats.\n\nThis bill would have allocated $20m towards security measures at the southern border with Mexico. The bill also set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for the construction of a border wall that was a signature project undertaken by Trump, and criticised by many Democrats.\n\nIndeed, during Trump\u2019s administration, Harris had called the idea of the wall \u201cun-American\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, she wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won\u2019t make us any safer.\u201d\n\nWhen she declared her candidacy for her 2020 presidential race in 2019, she called the wall Trump\u2019s \u201cmedieval vanity project\u201d.\n\nBesides pledging support for the bill that funds the wall, there are other indicators of Harris\u2019s hardening stance on immigration, including campaign advertisements in which she supports the idea of more Border Patrol agents.\n\nThis shift comes amid efforts by Republicans to hold Harris responsible for a surge in undocumented migrants into the US, by describing her as Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nNEW AD: On the border, the choice is simple. Kamala Harris is fighting to fix our broken immigration system. Donald Trump is trying to stop her. pic.twitter.com/t200w8iAYv \u2014 Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 30, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s her position on Medicare for All?\n\nWhen Harris was a senator for California, she signed on as a co-sponsor for Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All legislation which called for a single-payer health insurance system to provide everyone in the US with comprehensive healthcare.\n\nHowever, Harris\u2019s economic plan this time is silent on Medicare for All. So, it is unclear if she still backs the idea or has dropped it entirely.\n\nWill Harris ban fracking?\n\nDuring her 2019 primary run, Harris had also pledged to ban fracking \u2013 the controversial technique of extracting oil and gas from shale rock by drilling the earth.\n\nThe practice causes earth tremors and has a high environmental cost since the procedure consumes large amounts of water, in addition to releasing methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nHowever, Harris seems to have taken a U-turn on fracking during her presidential campaign this year. In late July, her campaign officials confirmed that she will not seek to ban fracking if elected.\n\nTrump had invoked her 2019 anti-fracking stance to criticise her.\n\nThe Biden administration allowed fracking. Harris herself has not made a public statement about whether or not she will ban fracking if she rises to the top job."

A group that supports Kamala Harris for president says Mr Kennedy's alleged removal and transportation of the skull of the whale may have broken the law. Mr Kennedy, 70, has not commented on the incident, detailed by his daughter in an interview 12 years ago. The call for an investigation comes days after he suspended his independent presidential campaign, which was marked by strange twists including his confession that he once dumped the body of a dead bear in New York's Central Park.\n\nMr Kennedy has now endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, and has been offered a place on the Republican candidate's transition team if he is elected. The incident with the whale's head, which dates to around 1994, was recounted by Kathleen \"Kick\" Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country magazine. Mr Kennedy, who is said to enjoy studying animal skulls and skeletons, reportedly heard that the dead animal had washed up in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where the family was staying. He went to the beach to cut off the head with a chainsaw, and then proceeded to tie it to the roof of the family minivan with bungee cords. The family then drove back to their home in New York, Ms Kennedy said. \"Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,\" Ms Kennedy told the magazine. \"We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.\" RFK Jr just endorsed Trump. Will it matter in November?\n\nAnalysis: Dead bear another strange twist in RFK Jr's campaign The call for an investigation was made by the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, which has publicly endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for president. The group wrote a letter to set out their case to marine protection officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The letter, quoted by US media, said Mr Kennedy may have broken multiple federal laws by collecting wildlife body parts and transporting them across state lines. \u201cVital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists,\" the group's political director Brett Hartl wrote. \"This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study,\u201d Mr Hartl added. Noaa confirmed to the BBC that it received the letter and was compiling a response. Mr Kennedy has not confirmed receipt of the letter. The BBC has approached his campaign for comment.\n\nUS election: RFK Jr drops presidential campaign and supports Donald Trump\n\nAt one point earlier this year, Mr Kennedy averaged about 15% in presidential preference polls as an independent candidate. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions, environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. But his numbers dwindled, and he announced last week he was suspending his campaign. Although he initially competed to win the Democratic nomination, he ended up criticising his former party and offering his endorsement to Donald Trump. The move dismayed his relatives, who are the most famous family in Democratic politics. Mr Kennedy's campaign attracted a range of bizarre and scandalous headlines. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. \u201cI have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,\u201d he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of \u201cgarbage\u201d but conceded that he had a \u201cvery, very rambunctious youth\u201d and that he was \u201cnot a church boy\u201d. Earlier this month, Mr Kennedy was filmed talking to actress Roseanne Barr, recounting the 2014 incident with the dead bear cub. He said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving in a rural area, and he put it in his van with the initial intention of harvesting its meat. But ultimately he thought it would be \"amusing\" to leave the carcass in New York's Central Park, to make it appear that an errant cyclist had killed the animal. The bear was found the following day. Responding to a BBC request for comment, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation said charges could not be brought for incidents more than a year old."

No economist on earth will support it, strategist says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the U.S., and implementing his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports would make inflation surge, according to a Nobel-prize winning economist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Trump were actually able to get his agenda through, it would be a disaster,\u201d Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Bill Clinton, told Quartz in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStiglitz, who more recently was head of the International Economic Association, said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201chas been a very steady hand with a set of well-talked-through proposals from the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrump every other day changes his mind about something,\u201d Stiglitz said, arguing that Trump\u2019s planned 50% tariffs on Chinese goods would slam lower- and middle-income Americans. \u201cThose tariffs would create a significant increase in the cost of living, it would be a shock to the economy, and that inflation, in turn, would lead the Fed to raise interest rates.\u201d\n\nReducing America\u2019s dependence on China can\u2019t be done with a sledgehammer, Stiglitz said. \u201cThe Biden-Harris proposal for a 10% tariff is an important signal to the market: \u2018You\u2019d better think about diversifying your supply chain.\u2019 And that, I would call good economic management. Good economic policy is balancing multiple concerns, and that kind of balancing is what distinguishes Harris from Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the specifics of Harris\u2019 plans, from boosting the child tax credit to planning to build three million new homes, Stiglitz said \u201cthe bundle as a whole is moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThose are cumulative problems that have been unattended for 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand so you\u2019re not going to be able to solve them overnight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 plans would also address the growth of monopolies, which have been holding back U.S. innovation and driving prices higher, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the weaknesses in the U.S. economy over the past 20 years has been a significant growth in market power, and that increase in market power reduces innovation, increases inequality, and lowers real wages of ordinary Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been one aspect of [the Biden-Harris] economic policy that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Trump and Harris lies in their tax policies.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 [Trump tax cut] was an enormous tax cut for the millionaires, and actually a tax increase when it was fully implemented for a large fraction of Americans,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWhat we need to do is restore tax justice, increase the taxes on the billionaires who can obviously afford it, and help address some of the big problems of inequality that we have, like child poverty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s move to cut the corporate income tax from 28% to to 21% did nothing to improve U.S. competitiveness, it just increased stock buybacks, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cExtending [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and making them deeper would make a huge hole in the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, the reason why they expired in 2025 was because the deficit created by the tax bill was so large that even Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe irony of his policies is that while a lot of support for them may come from people who feel like the system has left them behind,\u201d Siglitz added, \u201chis proposal will leave them even more behind.\u201d"

Auf Truth Social Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet bezeichnete Trump Harris\u2018 Antworten als \u201ezusammenhangloses Gerede\u201c, als sie von CNN-Moderatorin Dana Bash auf ihre fr\u00fcheren politischen Kehrtwendungen angesprochen wurde.\n\nAnzeige\n\nHarris\u2018 Erkl\u00e4rung, dass sich ihre \u201eWerte nicht ge\u00e4ndert haben\u201c, nahm Trump aufs Korn: \u201eDem stimme ich zu, ihre Werte haben sich nicht ge\u00e4ndert.\u201c Und f\u00fchrt fort: \u201eDie Grenze wird offen bleiben, es wird eine kostenlose Gesundheitsversorgung f\u00fcr illegale Einwanderer geben, ein Verbot von benzinbetriebenen Autos, die private Gesundheitsversorgung wird abgeschafft.\u201c Er warnte weiter, dass unter einer Pr\u00e4sidentschaft von Harris Amerika zu einem Brachland (\u201eWasteland\u201c) werden w\u00fcrde. 04:16 Uhr \u2013 Harris: Werde Fracking nicht verbieten \u201eAls Pr\u00e4sidentin werde ich Fracking nicht verbieten\u201c, sagte Kamala Harris in einem am Donnerstagabend (Ortszeit) ausgestrahlten Interview des Nachrichtensenders CNN.\n\nAnzeige\n\nIm Wahlkampf 2020 hatte die Vizepr\u00e4sidentin der USA noch gesagt, dass sie die umstrittene Praktik zur F\u00f6rderung von \u00d6l und Erdgas verbieten wolle.

Kennedy bei der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl am 5. November im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat North Carolina auf den Stimmzetteln stehen. Die dortige Wahlaufsicht lehnte am Donnerstag einen Antrag seiner Partei We The People ab, Kennedys Namen von den Stimmzetteln zu streichen.

US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin habe einem entsprechenden Hilfeersuchen des Heimatschutzministeriums zugestimmt, teilte Pentagon-Sprecherin Sabrina Singh mit. Austin habe den Befehlshaber des n\u00f6rdlichen US-Kommandos angewiesen, die Unterst\u00fctzung des f\u00fcr den Schutz der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten und ihre Stellvertreter zust\u00e4ndigen Secret Service zu verst\u00e4rken. Dies gelte auch f\u00fcr den gew\u00e4hlten Pr\u00e4sidenten und seinen Stellvertreter nach der Wahl am 5.

Die Buhrufe im Publikum ert\u00f6nten gleich zu Beginn des Auftritts des Senatos, andere Zuschauer applaudierten allerdings auch. \u201eKlingt so, als h\u00e4tten wir einige Fans und einige Hasser\u201c, sagte der 40-J\u00e4hrige bei der Konferenz in der Ostk\u00fcsten-Metropole Boston. \u201eDas ist in Ordnung. H\u00f6ren Sie sich an, was ich zu sagen habe, und ich werde meinen Standpunkt darlegen\u201c, so Vance weiter. 15:21 Uhr \u2013 Plattenfirma verbietet Trump, Abba-Songs auf Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu spielen\n\n\u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre Karrieren ausgewirkt haben\u201c, sagt Trump \u00fcber Clinton und Harris Die US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin der Demokraten, Kamala Harris, gibt zusammen mit Vizekandidat Tim Walz ihr erstes TV-Interview. Unterdessen geht Donald Trump einmal mehr unter die G\u00fcrtellinie. Erik Kirschbaum fasst die Ereignisse zusammen.\n\nDie Plattenfirma von ABBA fordert den US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Donald Trump auf, die zahlreichen Hits der schwedischen Kultband nicht mehr bei seinen Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu verwenden. Universal Music in Schweden teilte der Nachrichtenagentur AFP in einer E-Mail mit, auf Videos sei zu sehen, dass die Musik von ABBA bei mindestens einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung des Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten gespielt worden sei. \u201eWir haben verlangt, dass es heruntergenommen und entfernt wird\u201c, hie\u00df es \u00fcber das Material. Die Plattenfirma hob hervor, dass sie nicht um Erlaubnis f\u00fcr die Nutzung der ABBA-Songs gebeten worden sei.

Sie f\u00fchrt laut der am Donnerstag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Umfrage mit einer Zustimmung von 45 Prozent vor Trump mit 41 Prozent. Die Erhebung wurde in den vergangenen acht Tagen bis Mittwoch vorgenommen. In einer Umfrage von Reuters/Ipsos von Ende Juli hatte Harris bei registrierten W\u00e4hlern mit nur einem Prozentpunkt vor Trump gelegen. Die neue Umfrage hat eine Fehlerquote von zwei Prozent.

Damit legte sie im Vergleich zur letzten Erhebung im Juli bei beiden Gruppen weiter zu. Trump lag dagegen bei wei\u00dfen W\u00e4hlern und M\u00e4nnern unver\u00e4ndert vorn. Es sei offensichtlich, dass das Rennen gegen Harris f\u00fcr Trump eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung sei als der Wahlkampf gegen Biden, sagte der republikanische Wahlkampf-Experte Matt Wolking. Doch sei Harris f\u00fcr Trump \u201enicht un\u00fcberwindlich\u201c. Trump m\u00fcsse vor allem darauf achten, W\u00e4hler nun nicht zu verschrecken, die in der Vergangenheit zu ihm tendierten, weil sie Biden ablehnten. 14:00 Uhr \u2013 Pressesprecher von J.D. Vance soll Verbindungen zu Rechtsextremen haben Parker Magid, der neue Pressesprecher des republikanischen Vizekandidaten J.D. Vance, hat f\u00fcr eine Beraterfirma gearbeitet, die tief verflochten mit neurechten und rechtsextremen Think-Tanks sein soll. Das berichtet der \u201eGuadrian\u201c Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet . So soll die Beraterfirma Beck & Stone fundamentale Christen unterst\u00fctzen und der \u201eSociety for American Civic Renewal\u201c nahestehen, einer Geheimloge der Far-Right-Bewegung. Einer Extremismusforscherin zufolge, die der \u201eGuardian\u201c zitiert, handelt es sich bei den mit der Beraterfirma verwobenen Organisationen um solche, die in ihren Ansichten \u00fcber den konventionellen Konservatismus weit hinausgehen. 10:23 Uhr \u2013 Fotos von deutscher Influencerin von Pro-Trump-Accounts benutzt Pro-Trump-Accounts im Online-Dienst X bedienen sich bei Social-Media-Fotos von 17 europ\u00e4ischen Frauen. Das berichtet der US-Sender CNN. Auch mindestens eine Deutsche sei betroffen. Dies habe eine Untersuchung in Kooperation mit dem Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) ergeben. Die benutzten Fotos seien auf X-Profilen ausgespielt worden, die offenbar Teil einer koordinierten Kampagne waren, welche das Trump-Vance-Lager vor den Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen unterst\u00fctzen sollte. Laut CNN-Bericht zeigt eine Analyse dutzender Pro-Trump-Konten ein systematisches Muster von \u201enicht authentischem Verhalten\u201c. Alle Konten w\u00fcrden gestohlene oder manipulierte Fotos von jungen Frauen zeigen, die ihre Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Trump in Posts erkl\u00e4rten und Hashtags wie #MAGAPatriots oder #MAGA2024 verwendeten. Die Bilder seien oftmals manipuliert worden, um auf der Kleidung Trump-Slogans zu platzieren. Es gebe keinen Hinweis darauf, dass Trump und sein Team involviert waren.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl 2024 Dumm vs. d\u00fcmmer \u2013 Harris und Trump \u00fcberbieten sich mit \u00f6konomischer Ahnungslosigkeit\n\nEiner der Fake-Accounts, der im CNN-Artikel genannt wird, hei\u00dft @Luna_2K24.

Trump teilte auf der von ihm mit begr\u00fcndeten Plattform Truth Social den Beitrag eines anderen Nutzers, der andeutete, dass sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten Harris\u2018 politische Karriere bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten. In dem Post ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Kamala Harris zu sehen an der Seite der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton, die 2016 im Wahlkampf gegen Trump angetreten war. Dazu der Kommentar: \u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben...\u201c\n\nDie derbe Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sex-Skandal, in den Clintons Mann Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 \u2013 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Trump-Unterst\u00fctzer wiederum verbreiten v\u00f6llig unbelegte Behauptungen \u00fcber Harris, wonach die romantische Beziehung zu einem einflussreichen Politiker in Kalifornien in den 90er Jahren ihrer Karriere geholfen habe. 00:11 Uhr \u2013 Trump-Team \u00e4u\u00dfert sich zu Vorfall auf Soldatenfriedhof Donald Trump hatte am Montag auf dem Friedhof nahe der US-Hauptstadt Washington bei einer Kranzniederlegung der vor drei Jahren bei einem Selbstmordanschlag in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten US-Soldaten gedacht. Auch einige Familienmitglieder der Opfer waren anwesend. Nun wurde bekannt, dass es bei der Visite zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen Trumps Team und Mitarbeitern des Friedhofs kam. Kritiker warfen dem republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Trump vor, er habe seinen Besuch f\u00fcr Wahlkampfzwecke missbraucht. Seine Kampagne wies das zur\u00fcck. Die US-Rundfunkorganisation NPR berichtete, zwei Trump-Mitarbeiter h\u00e4tten bei dem Besuch einen Mitarbeiter des Friedhofs beschimpft und zur Seite geschubst, als dieser Film- und Fotoaufnahmen auf einem bestimmten Teil des Gel\u00e4ndes habe unterbinden wollen. Ein Trump-Sprecher schreibt nun auf der Plattform X, ein Fotograf sei zugelassen gewesen. In einer Stellungnahme f\u00fcr NPR erkl\u00e4rte dieser weiter, der Friedhofsmitarbeiter habe wohl \u201ean einer psychischen St\u00f6rung\u201c gelitten und sich Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams physisch in den Weg gestellt.\n\nTrumps Wahlkampfteam ver\u00f6ffentlichte auf X au\u00dferdem eine Stellungnahme von Angeh\u00f6rigen der in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten Soldaten, die dem Republikaner f\u00fcr seinen Besuch dankten. Sie h\u00e4tten der Teilnahme eines Fotografen zugestimmt, und das Verhalten von Trump und dessen Team sei von gr\u00f6\u00dftem Respekt gepr\u00e4gt gewesen. Mittwoch, 28.

            "text": "The official J.D. Vance Bad Press Tour keeps on rolling this week, as the Republican vice presidential hopeful faces scrutiny over 2021 comments he made bashing teachers without biological children, including American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten.\n\nAlready grappling with widespread backlash over another 2021 jab calling Democratic politicians and voters \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d Vance now must answer more questions about further comments he made during an October 2021 political event for the Center for Christian Virtue. \u201cSo many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they\u2019re people without kids trying to brainwash the minds of our children. That really disorients me and disturbs me,\u201d Vance said during the event. \u201cRandi Weingarten, who\u2019s the head of the most powerful teachers\u2019 union in the country, she doesn\u2019t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\u201d\n\nWeingarten is a lesbian, and introduced the public to her wife, Liz Margolies, in 2007. Vance\u2019s disparaging remarks, however, were also inaccurate: Weingarten, believed to be the first openly LGBTQ+ president of a major U.S. labor union, is stepmother to Margolies\u2019 biological children, and described herself as a \u201cmother by marriage\u201d last year when subjected to similar attacks on her motherhood by Vance\u2019s GOP colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nStill, Vance doubled down on, and falsely reframed, his own remarks while being interviewed on the tarmac outside the Trump-Vance campaign jet this week, as CNN reported. \u201cI didn\u2019t criticize Randi Weingarten for not having kids, I criticized her for wanting to brainwash mine,\u201d Vance claimed. Meanwhile, Weingarten responded in an MSNBC interview, calling his comments \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d\n\nA Viral Image Appears to Show Virulently Anti-LGBTQ+ VP Candidate J.D. Vance in Drag Content creator and podcast host Matt Bernstein posted the image to X and Instagram over the weekend.\n\nVance has not specifically stated in what way he believes Weingarten is \u201cbrainwashing\u201d his children. His statement at the Center for Christian Virtue event was made in the general context of \u201cthe ideology of the left,\u201d which Vance characterized as \u201ccontrol[ling] what our children learn.\u201d Similarly vague, yet apocalyptic, rhetoric about Weingarten and the AFT has proliferated on the right over the last several years. In a 2022 interview, former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Weingarten \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d and alleged that teachers\u2019 unions are \u201cthe most likely to take this republic down.\u201d Other Republican lines of attack have included the accusation that Weingarten and the AFT puppeteered the U.S.\u2019 COVID-19 policy, which Weingarten flatly denied and called \u201cwild allegations.\u201d"

            "headline": "Kamala\u2019s Moment",
            "text": "The Precise Time Department sounds like something from a story by Jorge Luis Borges, but it is a real subdivision of the US Navy. At the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris has her official residence, the department maintains the Master Clock with which all others in the military system are harmonized. At the end of the driveway that leads from the vice-president\u2019s house, there is a public display of these exact hours, minutes, and seconds set beside a huge ship\u2019s anchor, as though this superaccurate chronometer served to hold America steady and prevent it from coming unmoored. Such reassurance seems, of course, ever more illusory.\n\nThere is a melancholy evocation of the Master Clock and its merciless motions at the start of Promise Me, Dad (2017), Joe Biden\u2019s account of his public and private lives in 2014. Biden was then living at the Naval Observatory as vice-president to Barack Obama. Leaving the residence for his family\u2019s annual Thanksgiving gathering in Nantucket, he seemed momentarily mesmerized:\n\nI glanced at the squat, standing digital clock at the top of the driveway, as I had maybe a thousand times since we had moved into the official residence. Red numbers glowed, ticking away in metronomic perfection: 5:11:42, 5:11:43, 5:11:44, 5:11:45\u2026. Precise Time\u2014synchronized to the millisecond\u2014had been deemed an operational imperative by the Department of Defense, which had troops and bases in locations around the globe. 5:11:50, 5:11:51, 5:11:52.\n\nOur limousine was already accelerating out of the turn with an abrupt force that pushed me back into the soft leather seats. The clock was behind us in a flash, out of sight, but still marking the time as it melted away\u20145:11:58, 5:11:59, 5:12:00.\n\nFor Biden, time was melting away. He did not get to be his party\u2019s nominee for president in 2016, and that in turn meant that he would be too old to stand for a second term in 2024. Hard as he tried, he could not, in the end, escape the clock\u2019s relentless indifference to his desire to stay in power. But for Harris, the glowing red numbers that haunted Biden may mark the precise time. They have hurried her to a moment not just of personal destiny but of historic fate.\n\nHarris\u2019s rapid coronation as the Democratic candidate for the presidency is at once quite fortuitous and utterly timely. It might be called an accident that\u2019s been waiting to happen. An accident because were it not for a series of unprecedented events\u2014Biden\u2019s becoming the oldest president in US history, his disintegration in a live televised debate, Donald Trump\u2019s political resurgence after an attempted coup and personal resurrection after an attempted assassination\u2014neither she nor any other Black woman would have become the candidate of either of the two main parties. The time, in conventional wisdom, would not have been right. The voters would not have been ready. The clock would have to tick on through endless cycles before the day arrived when it would feel safe to have, at the top of the ticket, an embodiment of American power that was neither white nor male.\n\nAnd yet it was an accident waiting to happen because this conventional wisdom is itself out of sync with a nation in which white men make up just 30 percent of the population. This is the minority that benefits from a spectacular application of positive discrimination in the political sphere: it accounts for close to two thirds of officeholders. By contrast, only three Black women\u2014Shirley Chisholm in 1972, Carol Moseley Braun in 2004, and Harris in 2020\u2014have previously even sought a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and only three (including Harris) have served in the Senate. No Black woman has been elected as a governor, and only twenty-five have held other senior statewide offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, or secretary of state.\n\nTime shapes contemporary American politics in two additional ways\u2014anachronism and gerontocracy. Biden, because of who he is, seemed to embody both the superannuated nature of America\u2019s political class and its overrepresentation of white men of the baby boomer generation. Harris, because of who she is, is uniquely placed to call time on both these realities\u2014which means, first of all, calling time on Donald Trump. If she frames her campaign effectively, Harris can make Trump a throwback and herself the embodiment of a future that has already taken shape in American demography.\n\nThat campaign can and must be about the things that affect people\u2019s daily lives\u2014jobs, health care, education, the climate crisis. But ticking away underneath it is another kind of question: Who is a normal American now? Harris\u2019s choice of running mate suggests she is aware of this: the avuncular Minnesota governor Tim Walz has a gift for making progressive ideals seem familiar, ordinary, and rooted in down-home common sense. Meanwhile, Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, implicitly appeal to a more symbolic notion of representation: however complex and diverse American society might seem to be, its essential form is male, white, and at least culturally Christian. This has always been so in the past and must always be so in the future. If demography, and therefore democracy, is flowing away from this eternal truth, then democracy must be frozen in time. When Trump told a right-wing Christian audience on July 26 that if they vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d they \u201cwon\u2019t have to do it anymore,\u201d he was putting forward his own notion of the end of history. The changes that are making the US more ethnically diverse, less comfortably patriarchal, and less Christian will be permanently checked because the institutions of power will have been made safe from their effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the problem with Biden\u2019s candidacy was that, for vastly more benign reasons, it drew on a parallel idea of holding back a tide of change. Biden presented himself, not without reason, as a bulwark, the only immovable object that could stop the apparently unstoppable Trump. As the Democratic candidate, Harris has rightly taken up Biden\u2019s message that the election in November is, as the outgoing president put it in his address from the Oval Office on July 24, about \u201csaving our democracy.\u201d But her candidacy carries a much stronger resonance. It says that saving American democracy is not at all the same thing as preserving it.\n\nBiden used the metaphor made famous by John F. Kennedy when he became, at forty-three, the second-youngest president in US history: \u201cI\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\u201d But the torch of American democracy must be envisaged as a flickering flame. In her rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, Hillary Clinton spoke of how \u201cevery generation has carried the torch forward.\u201d It is not a secure and fixed inheritance that can be handed down as a bequest from one generation to the next. It is a dangerous and endangered idea that must always draw fuel from new sources. American democracy cannot be saved if it is not reimagined, deepened, expanded, and brought into line with contemporary American realities. It is open to Harris to embody the energy of that urgent updating. Indeed, she can scarcely do otherwise.\n\nIt would be good to live in a world where Harris\u2019s gender and ethnicity were irrelevant and where she was judged solely on her record and ideas. But if there is any such world, it does not include the US. Trump, Vance, and the Republican Party will not permit such a possibility. Their reactionary mindset is obsessed with human biology\u2014Harris, for them, is inescapably defined by her chromosomes. The idea of the reproduction of America through the generations is projected onto her body. So far as we know, none of the forty-five occupants to date of the Oval Office has given birth to a child\u2014but in Harris\u2019s case this nonevent is a neglect of biological duty that makes her, in Vance\u2019s words, one of the \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d who don\u2019t \u201chave a direct stake\u201d in the country\u2019s future. The point of this contention is precisely that it is a claim on the future. Tomorrow belongs to Vance and those who look and think like him.\n\nHarris does, of course, have children through her marriage to Doug Emhoff, but because she did not give birth to them, Vance cited her first among the ranks of \u201cpeople without children.\u201d This, crucially, excludes her from the norm and indeed makes her the prime example of those who \u201chate normal Americans for choosing family.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that Harris has failed to give birth; it is also that she has failed to be properly born. John Eastman, a coconspirator in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 election, sought the Republican nomination for California attorney general in 2010, the year Harris won that office. In August 2020 Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman protesting that \u201cbefore we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris\u2019 eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth.\u201d He claimed (on spurious constitutional grounds) that since (as he thought) Harris\u2019s parents were in the United States on temporary visas when she was born in October 1964, she\n\nowed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers\u2014Jamaica, in the case of her father, and India, in the case of her mother\u2014and was therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment as originally understood.\n\nAt the time Trump amplified this bogus allegation, describing Eastman as a \u201cvery highly qualified, very talented lawyer\u201d and remarking that\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI heard it today that she doesn\u2019t meet the requirements\u2026. I have no idea if that\u2019s right, I would\u2019ve\u2014I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026very serious.\n\nOn August 19, as the Democratic convention was opening, Trump returned to this theme, asking of the Democrats: \u201cI wonder if they knew where she comes from.\u201d In this upending of the idea of birthright, Harris has no right to be American because she was born wrong. If there\u2019s a genre underpinning the Republican disdain for Harris, it\u2019s a nativity play that has become a horror movie. In Eastman\u2019s narrative, she was already, at the very moment of her birth, a traitor to America, loyal to two foreign powers. According to Vance\u2019s rhetoric, this misbegotten woman has grown up to be the potential begetter of a sterile American future.\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been attacked with both these biological weapons. Barack Obama had to face down Trump\u2019s birther lies but not the other natalist assault as well. No one said he hated ordinary Americans because he had not brought his own pregnancy to term. Yet it is the very unprecedented nature of this double assault on her bodily being that also gives Harris an exceptional power. She knows how to deal with this stuff\u2014she has been doing so all her life, with considerable grace.\n\nIt seems telling that Trump has had to abandon his mocking nickname for her, Laffin\u2019 Kamala, presumably because of a belated realization that her laughter\u2014so different from his own cruel comedy\u2014seems to most people to express optimism, youthfulness, and a joy in life, all qualities that he (as well as Biden) so patently lacks. She politicizes the idea of being comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. And in that comfort, there is a paradoxical kind of potency. She can be extremely radical by presenting herself merely as what she is. For if Harris really is a \u201cnormal American\u201d (as of course she is), it can only be because the American norm has been transformed. It can be possible because the torch has already been passed not just to a new generation but to new forms of personal and collective self-definition.\n\nHarris is fluent in a kind of baby talk very different from the demented babble of the Republican assaults on her. She does not run from the politicization of her body\u2014she embraces it. She is, in the way she tells her own story, a child of struggle. In her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey (2019), the earliest memory she recounts is of \u201ca sea of legs moving about, of the energy and shouts and chants.\u201d She gives us an infant\u2019s-eye view of political activism, with her looking up from her stroller at the legs of fellow civil rights marchers. Her cutest baby anecdote is freighted with time and history: \u201cMy mother would laugh telling a story she loved about the time when I was fussing as a toddler. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 she asked, trying to soothe me. \u2018Fweedom!\u2019 I yelled back.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the only good moment in her primary campaign of 2019, Harris identified herself explicitly and indignantly as a Black child of the 1960s. She attacked Biden for his opposition to the policy of integrating school systems by busing pupils from Black families to white-dominated areas: \u201cYou know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Her campaign tweeted a picture of Harris as a little girl, her hair in pigtails tied with bows. It then produced T-shirts printed with this image and the words \u201c THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME .\u201d Childhood yarns are part of the grammar of American politics, but this one is different. It is more defiant than endearing, more confrontational than sentimental.\n\nThe image of a Black girl in pigtails has its own specific history. In 1954, just months after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found educational segregation to be unconstitutional, Scientific American published an article titled \u201cThe Biology of the Negro.\u201d It was written by Curt Stern, an influential geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley\u2014the same university to which Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had traveled from India to study nutrition and endocrinology. It followed a lecture Stern had delivered in 1946 under the title \u201cWhy Do People Differ?\u201d According to the historian of medicine Michael Yudell:\n\nThe program for the lecture pictured a cartoon with three girls, two of whom were white, one black. The local chapter of the NAACP objected to the picture of a shabbily dressed black girl in pigtails wearing boots flanked by two well-dressed white girls looking at the black girl and smiling.\n\nBut in 1964, just months before Harris was born, Look magazine published what became a famous painting by Norman Rockwell called The Problem We All Live With. It shows another little Black girl in pigtails, this time neatly dressed in all-white clothes that emphasize the color of her skin. She is six-year-old Ruby Bridges, walking determinedly to her first day at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans in 1960. Towering over her, so high that their faces are out of the frame, are four men identified by their yellow armbands as deputy US marshals. Behind Bridges is a wall splattered with the bloodred juice of a hurled tomato and graffitied in bold letters with the N-word. By inviting his viewers to see this painting as a reality \u201cwe all\u201d live with, Rockwell was saying this violence is every bit as American as his supposedly nostalgic images of a vanishing small-town way of life.\n\nWhen Harris produced her THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME T-shirts, she was invoking her own history as well as the image of Ruby Bridges. And what\u2019s striking about this is that \u201ca Norman Rockwell view of America\u201d is proverbial shorthand for a sanitized and sentimentalized version of the past. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear (2018), Trump\u2019s economic adviser Gary Cohn made this very accusation against the then president in a heated argument over the nature of contemporary America: \u201c\u2018Mr. President,\u2019 Cohn said, trying to summarize, \u2018You have a Norman Rockwell view of America.\u2019\u201d Harris, to the contrary, evokes a very different \u201cNorman Rockwell view of America,\u201d one in which racial violence and resistance are acknowledged as part of a shared reality.\n\nThe creation of \u201cthat little girl\u201d involved the making of a profound choice about American history\u2014and about its most toxic aspect: slavery. Of all the \u201cfirsts\u201d that Harris represents\u2014first female vice-president, first Black woman and first Indian American to contest the presidency\u2014the one that goes unspoken is that if she wins in November, she will be the first openly acknowledged descendant of slaves to lead America. In this identification there is a complex interplay between freedom and necessity. It can perhaps best be appreciated through the uncanny recurrence of the same Irish name in her genealogy and in Biden\u2019s: Finnegan or Finegan. It is Biden\u2019s mother\u2019s surname and a constant point of reference in his idea of who he really is. It lives on in the name of his granddaughter Finnegan. It is also the name of Harris\u2019s father\u2019s maternal grandmother, Miss Iris, a Black woman born, as he recalled in a 2020 essay, \u201cIris Finegan.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s parents split up when she was five, and her father subsequently had a limited place in her life. Donald Harris, a leftist critic of orthodox theories of underdevelopment, became the first Black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford\u2019s economics department. He wrote of Kamala and her sister, Maya, that \u201cmy one big regret is that they did not come to know very well the two most influential women in my life,\u201d Miss Iris and his other grandmother, Miss Chrishy. Donald reproduced with his essay a photograph of Miss Iris with a two-year-old Kamala on her knee. He recalled how\n\nwe drove up to Thatch Walk and worked our way, with lots of cuts and bruises, through the same cane fields where Miss Iris had run a thriving business in the \u201cgood ole days\u201d of sugar and, a long time before, had probably been part of a slave plantation.\n\nThis locates a potential American president in the fields where some of her ancestors were enslaved to the brutal task of cutting cane.\n\nIn this other history, a name like Finegan loses the meaning it has for Biden: a sense of continuity, an uncomplicated connection to a genetic heritage. These Irish ancestors cannot be assumed to be what they are to Biden\u2014heroic underdogs. Miss Chrishy was born Christiana Brown, and Donald Harris believes her to be a \u201cdescendant of Hamilton Brown.\u201d Hamilton Brown, who owned a large number of slaves in Jamaica and fiercely opposed abolition, was also Irish, born in County Antrim. But unlike John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Biden, and even Barack Obama, all of whom engaged in the public ritual of visiting Ireland to celebrate their ancestral roots, Harris would probably not want to celebrate her distant Finegan and Brown cousins.\n\nThis is because Blackness is seldom a free choice. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists at the end of July, Trump claimed that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d and had previously been identifying only with her Indian heritage. \u201cIs she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one but she obviously doesn\u2019t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she became a Black person.\u201d This was a lie\u2014Harris has always identified as Black. But it also revealed a certain kind of truth about one of the ways racism operates: Trump\u2019s attack on Harris was based on the assumption that she must be either Black or not Black.\n\nIt is easy for white Americans to pick an ethnicity\u2014Biden could have decided to identify with his French or English, rather than his Irish, heritage. It is easy for white Americans to tell little lies about their ancestry. Trump himself has more than once falsely claimed that his father, Fred, who was born in New York, was in fact born in Germany: \u201cMy father is German, was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany, so I have a very great feeling for Germany.\u201d Fred Trump himself claimed for some years that he was Swedish. Harris, on the other hand, could not cherry-pick from among her complex origins. Her mother was indeed born in India and lived there until she was nineteen. Yet Gopalan understood that her girls were not going to be perceived in America as Brahmins. As Harris puts it in The Truths We Hold:\n\nMy mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.\n\nThis is not a relishing of the openness of identity in America. It is something much more serious: an attempt to find the freedom within inevitability. Gopalan understood that her daughters could not escape the identity that a racist society would impose on them, including the history of enslavement that is part of their ancestry. What they could do is find the pride within that identity and embody the resistance that is the other side of that history.\n\nThey had to do this in an atmosphere of ferocious political engagement, in which these same questions of freedom and necessity were being hammered out within Black radicalism. Trump seeks to define Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d and there is no doubt that Republicans will delve into her parents\u2019 political stances in the 1960s to find evidence for this characterization. But it is the exact opposite of the truth. The radical left is a huge influence on Harris\u2014in the sense that she is part of a generational reaction against the revolutionary Black politics of the 1960s. She is a child of the revolution only in the sense that she grew up in its wreckage.\n\nThere is a figure in The Truths We Hold who is both named and not named, both intimately embraced and held at a distance. He is introduced as follows: Harris writes that San Francisco State University \u201chad a student-run Experimental College, and in 1966, another of my mother\u2019s dear friends, whom I knew as Uncle Aubrey, taught the college\u2019s first-ever class in black studies.\u201d We later learn that Aubrey\u2019s aunt, Regina Shelton, was a \u201csecond mother\u201d to Kamala and that \u201cwe shared a long-standing relationship of love, care, and connection\u201d to this extended family. Uncle Aubrey is not given his full name, Aubrey LaBrie. Nor does Harris say much about his politics.\n\nIn 2019 Harris told Molly Ball of Time that she remembered coming \u201cdown the stairs of her childhood house in Berkeley to see FREE BOBBY carved in wet cement, after the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was arrested.\u201d Her childhood world was that from which the Panthers emerged. In 1965 LaBrie, along with his brothers Huey and Abdul and other friends, founded a periodical called Black Dialogue. It was in part a cultural magazine, publishing stories, poems, and essays alongside graphic art by young Black painters. But it was also highly political, and Aubrey is listed as its \u201cpolitical editor,\u201d presumably responsible for its ideological direction. Its first issue appeared in the aftermath of the murder of Malcolm X and is \u201cproudly dedicated\u201d to his memory as a \u201cgreat leader and a greater MAN .\u201d\n\nIt was also produced immediately after the brutal police assault on peaceful civil rights marchers at Selma. It seethes with both the passion and the anguish of uncertainty that so many young Black activists felt in the face of such loss and violence. It despairs of the possibilities of looking to the two spheres that Kamala Harris would go on to inhabit\u2014the law and democratic politics\u2014to win justice:\n\nThe Black Americans are nauseated by the practices of the White community that are, to them, mockingly meaningless, hypocritical, dishonest and essentially amoral. These young Black people have no faith in the Constitution and no respect for the White man\u2019s law. Why should they? What has it done for them? The law is dispensed in a manner which makes it a great big atrocious lie. It is merely another weapon to use against them.\n\nAfter the Watts riots in Los Angeles in August 1965, when South Central LA became a combat zone and thirty-four people died, Black Dialogue published a call to arms by Aubrey LaBrie\u2019s younger brother Huey:\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters of Watts, how proud we are of you. You who burned the city of angels and shook the crumbling white power structure\u2026. The enemy called it a riot but we know that it was an insurrection. It was one battle in the \u201cwar of Armageddon\u201d or the war between the black and white. The blacks who participated in the insurrection introduced an extremely effective tactic of igniting fires to local parasitical white business communities. They were not rioters or hoodlums, they were guerrillas.\n\nThere is an irony here. The \u201cwar of Armageddon,\u201d as invoked in Black Dialogue, was almost certainly drawn from the preaching of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. But it now has no purchase on the American left or on mainstream Black politics. Where it does have a strong grip is on the dark imagination of Trumpism. The insurrectionist violence that Trump unleashed with the invasion of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was fed by the millenarian vision of a coming civil war, framed by many of its believers as a racial \u201cwar between the black and white.\u201d The Republican Party has moved into the orbit of apocalyptic tribalism. If you want to see a figure who represents the most definitive movement out of that orbit, look at Harris.\n\nHarris told Ball in 2019 that \u201cthe reality is that when you are the so-called minority you learn many languages, necessarily.\u201d She did not mean literal languages but rather the languages of power. Harris entered the very arenas her mother\u2019s friends and political allies had despaired of: the law, party politics, elective public office. She chose to believe what the previous generation could not\u2014that justice can be achieved by working from inside the existing institutional structures. It is an act of faith that critics of her work as a prosecutor and attorney general in California do not believe to be justified in practice by the way she used her power. She sought to uphold some wrongful convictions, threatened to prosecute parents of habitually truant children (a policy that disproportionately affected people of color), and even appealed a federal court ruling that California\u2019s death penalty is unconstitutional (in spite of her own complete repudiation of the death penalty). But her caution is not mere moderation or bland centrism. It comes from a complex personal and political navigation between the desire for freedom on the one side and the tight constraints of reality on the other.\n\nThat weighing of what is right against what is possible is the business of democracy, and Harris represents the way the left has accepted that difficult responsibility. American politics has ended up in a place where it is those on the right who want to burn everything down. They will do that, if they can, in the name of a phony American normality that excludes Harris and everyone who shares with her a complex identity. It is striking, therefore, that Harris\u2019s candidacy has given Democrats permission to point out how \u201cweird\u201d the Republicans\u2019 version of America really is. Walz put the word into circulation just days after Biden announced his departure from the national stage. In a punchy statement after Trump appeared on Fox News, the Harris campaign listed as one of the main takeaways: \u201cTrump is old and quite weird?\u201d The conjunction of these two qualities implies that what is truly strange is not just Trump\u2019s chronological age but the anachronistic vision in which only white men who plant their seed in fertile women are authentic citizens and legitimate rulers. Against that weirdness, we have the real possibility of a president whose history is synchronized with American reality.\n\n\u2014August 20, 2024"

            "text": "When Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate for this November\u2019s presidential election, most Americans had no idea who the Minnesota governor actually was. But as people outside of Minnesota get to know Walz, it\u2019s becoming clear through a torrent of stories shared online that he\u2019s one of the most likable politicians around. Why? He just seems like a very normal and kind person. And it\u2019s hard to find a sharper contrast between Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate JD Vance than \u201cnormal and kind.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump and Vance are clearly frustrated with being called \u201cweird,\u201d a verbal jab against modern Republicans that was first popularized by Walz. But Trump and Vance are clearly stumped about how to hit back. Because every new day online seems to deliver an anecdote or story from Walz that makes him seem both relatable and caring. And after years of Trumpism dominating the headlines with an ideology built on cruelty and humiliation, a guy like Walz is extremely refreshing.\n\nTake an old story about Walz that started going viral on Wednesday. Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, was interviewed by Politico about the fact that she would become the first Native American woman to be governor of any state. At the end of the interview, Flanagan told a story about how Walz helped her when her child got lice.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nI heard you say that your daughter was discovered to have lice the day after the 2018 election. Can you share how the newly elected Walz-Flanagan ticket handled that early crisis? My first instinct was to call Congressman Tim Walz, also governor-elect Tim Walz, to say, \u201cHelp, my child has lice, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d So that was interesting. But he was amazing. I was super freaked out. We\u2019d never dealt with it before. Siobhan was a total trooper. He said, \u201cGo to Target, and then FaceTime me from the aisle.\u201d And so I did. He had me show all the different shampoos and stuff. He was like, \u201cThis is the one that you get.\u201d And then he\u2019s like, \u201cOnce you get home, FaceTime me again.\u201d So I FaceTimed him again from the bathroom, as I\u2019m picking nits out of my child\u2019s hair. And he was amazing and coached me through the whole thing, and that is who Tim Walz is.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of story that we\u2019re hearing more and more about Walz over the years. As a teacher and coach, he touched the lives of so many people as a helpful father figure, as so many of his former students tell it. And the army of pro-Trump trolls who are trying to take him down just don\u2019t understand his appeal.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s been going viral this week involving Walz is his interview with Subway Takes on TikTok. Walz discusses how important he thinks good gutter maintenance is. And it\u2019s just the latest example of Walz talking about normal things that normal people discuss in their everyday lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to post the most vile things imaginable on social media. For example, Trump retweeted an image on Truth Social that showed Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris with the caption, \u201cFunny how blowjobs impacted both of their careers differently.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d as it were is that Clinton\u2019s husband was involved with a White House intern in the 1990s and Harris was dating Willie Brown. The right has repeatedly tried to claim, without any evidence, that she only succeeded professionally because she was dating Brown. It\u2019s a common attack from retrograde assholes. But normal people don\u2019t find it amusing. At least they don\u2019t anymore.\n\nThe late-night comedians of the 1990s tore Monica Lewinsky to shreds with those kinds of jokes. But here in the 2020s, the U.S. public sees Lewinsky much differently than she was depicted in late 20th-century news and comedy programs. And that\u2019s probably why these assholes don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re the weird ones. Guys like Trump and Vance are trying to bring America back to the 1990s, back when Trump thought he was hot shit and Vance was a kid. Both men are trying to turn back the clock, from their stupid jokes to their ideas about reproductive health. But there\u2019s a reason that Harris has embraced a slogan that really seems to resonate with most people: We\u2019re not going back."

She addressed plans to make housing more affordable and to expand the child tax credit, and she acknowledged that despite economic growth since the pandemic, prices are still too high for many Americans.\n\n\u201cPrices, in particular for groceries, are still too high. The American people know it. I know it,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris, who was joined by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sat down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for the interview during a campaign swing in Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe wide-ranging conversation was a high-stakes moment for Harris, after she had faced mounting pressure to do an interview with a major news outlet to share her own policies and take questions on her prior positions, some of which have changed since she became President Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020.\n\nBash pressed Harris on her shifted stances on both banning fracking and decriminalizing border crossings. Harris in 2019, when she first ran for president, said she was against a fracking ban and was for decriminalizing border crossings. Her stance on both policies has changed since then \u2014 but Harris insisted that her values have not.\n\n\u201cI think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is, my values have not changed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\u201d\n\nHarris said she would keep her word that she would not ban fracking \u2014 an issue that is front and center in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd on decriminalizing border crossings, Harris said, \u201cI believe there should be consequences. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHarris also addressed foreign policy, namely the continued U.S. aid to Israel in its war in Gaza. When asked if Harris would withhold some shipments of weapons to Israel, Harris did not directly answer the question, and instead reiterated her call for a ceasefire deal and getting the hostages home.\n\n\u201cI remain committed since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self determination and dignity,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the interview, Harris also committed to having a Republican in her presidential cabinet \u2013 and said it would be to the benefit of the American public to have someone who has different views and different experiences working with her.\n\nThe interview was wide-ranging, covering Walz\u2019s record and past controversies, President Biden\u2019s legacy and ability to serve, as well as the phone call between Biden and Harris the day he decided to step down from the race.\n\nQuestions over Walz\u2019 comments on weapons of war, and his path to having children\n\nWalz had only a few questions directed at him during the interview. He was asked about previous comments he made in 2018 about carrying a weapon into war \u2013 which Walz never did. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war and my wife, the English teacher, telling me my grammar is not always correct,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cMy record speaks for itself\u2026 I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWalz and his wife used a method known as IUI to have children \u2013 but has said they used IVF in the past. On that issue, Walz said he thinks most Americans \u201cget it if you\u2019ve been through that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child,\u201d he said.\n\nNew details on the call between Biden and Harris when Biden stepped down\n\nHarris revealed that she was spending time with her family, cooking breakfast and about to sit down for a puzzle when Biden called her last month to let her know he was ending his campaign for reelection.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 \u201d Harris said.\n\nShe noted that Biden made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that he was going to support Harris\u2019 campaign for president. She called the president \u201cselfless\u201d and said he puts the American people first.\n\nRepublicans like Trump had been accusing Harris of trying to dodge tough questions\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a month since Biden dropped out of the race, and in the absence of a 1-on-1 Harris interview or press conference, Republicans have accused the vice president of trying to dodge the press to avoid tough questions. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done an interview,\u201d former President Donald Trump said during a news conference earlier this month at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent, and she can\u2019t do an interview.\u201d\n\nPrior to becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris had taken plenty of questions from reporters as the sitting vice president. Her team says she\u2019s done 80 interviews this year \u2014 in traditional, network media as well as on podcasts and social media.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut in these previous conversations she was generally selling Biden\u2019s agenda. Like most vice presidents, she was a messenger and a deputy. Now, she\u2019s running for the top job, and this CNN interview may be one of the first times she\u2019s pressed to spell out her own policies and answer questions about how, if at all, she would govern differently than Biden.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d have to answer more of these questions,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible to run for president and not answer them.\u201d\n\nHarris will, undoubtedly, face additional scrutiny about her record and positions when she faces off against Trump in the debate expected next month.\n\nTrump, for his part, posted on his platform Truth Social as the interview with Harris aired on CNN.\n\n\u201cI look so forward to Debating Comrade Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is. Harris has changed every one of her long held positions, on everything,\u201d he said. He also posted: \u201cBORING!!!\u201d\n\n"

Read preview\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, one issue at the forefront of voters' minds is how to afford a house as homeownership becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Harris-Walz campaign unveiled a slew of housing policies to combat this issue, including a proposal to provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, with more generous aid for first-generation homeowners.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAt first glance, down payment assistance might seem like a great idea, but according to Zillow Chief Economist Skylar Olsen, it's not an effective solution to the housing crisis.\n\nPolicies like these effectively act as subsidies that cause widespread spikes in housing demand as people rush to buy, according to Olsen. However, if nothing is done to address the dearth of housing supply, then jump-starting nationwide demand will simply exacerbate the housing crisis as people scramble to snatch up already-scarce homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The demand side doesn't help over the long run,\" Olsen said. \"If you want sweeping policy that's very generalizable, have it be on the supply side.\"\n\nOlsen also doesn't think the first-time homebuyer criteria is the most useful way to increase housing access for those who need it the most.\n\n\"I could be a first-time buyer, but I have a great network, a bank of mom and dad, that could help me move forward. And now you've given me an extra boost,\" Olsen said.\n\nFocusing on boosting first-generation homeownership could help combat that issue, which Harris' plan addresses, although the exact details have yet to be revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Olsen believes a federal down payment assistance plan is simply a band-aid fix for structural issues in the US housing market \u2014 namely, lack of supply.\n\n\"It can end up just getting us revved up without solving the long-run problem,\" Olsen said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHere's what will actually help home affordability\n\nThat's not to say that all down payment assistance plans are doomed to fail. When done right, these programs can be quite beneficial, Olsen said.\n\nThe key comes down to whether such a plan is implemented at the federal or local level. According to Olsen, local homebuying incentives that increase demand are more targeted than a blanket federal policy like the one Harris proposed, making them more effective in increasing homeowning accessibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, a state with a low population might have a lot of underused infrastructure. In this case, incentives to boost housing demand at the state level could help redistribute people to areas with excess home supply.\n\n\"If you want to solve things with the demand side of the coin for the long run, it's gonna be more about 'How do I get the people to want to go where the supply is?'\" Olsen said.\n\nBut again, Olsen believes that policies increasing the housing supply are the most effective way to alleviate the current housing crisis.\n\nHarris has actually put out proposals addressing the supply side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion aims to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. The fund will provide $20 billion in funding to lower land use restrictions, modernize zoning policies, stimulate development, and encourage innovative housing solutions. This plan emphasizes building multifamily rental units and starter homes for middle-class families, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of units.\n\nAnd the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit provides tax credits to developers who build affordable housing units, which helps low-income tenants in finding affordable and available units. This policy encourages mixed-income developments such as multifamily housing rented to tenants from a variety of income backgrounds."

Now they finally have a presidential ticket that explicitly echoes their agenda.\n\nThese activists and their diverse coalition \u2014 who call themselves YIMBYs, for \"yes in my backyard\" \u2014 have sprung into action to support Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. On Wednesday night, they held a two-hour virtual \"YIMBYs for Harris\" fundraiser featuring dozens of local, state, and federal lawmakers who believe in building lots more housing.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nPro-housing advocates say Harris' proposal to build 3 million homes in her first term, in part through cutting government regulations restricting construction, feels like a big shift toward addressing the country's housing shortage. It doesn't hurt that Harris selected as her running mate a governor who has championed pro-housing policies in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris and other top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, highlighted the housing shortage in their speeches at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 sending YIMBYs into a tizzy. Democrats in Washington have long supported demand-side housing policies, including subsidies for homebuyers and low-income renters. But recent national messaging on the issue has focused much more squarely on solving the supply shortage, which is particularly severe in blue states and cities where onerous permitting requirements, environmental reviews, and opposition from so-called NIMBYs \u2014 \"not in my backyard\" \u2014 have hamstrung efforts to build more homes.\n\n\"There's always been Democrats saying we should fund more affordable housing,\" Armand Domalewski, a San Francisco-based data analyst who helped organize YIMBYs for Harris, told Business Insider. What's new on the national stage, he added, is \"the perspective that part of the issue is local and state governments obstructing housing.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nShortly after Domalewski set up a WhatsApp group for pro-housing voters about three weeks ago, \"it just exploded,\" he said. About 300 people are in the chat, he said, and the group estimated that about 6,000 people attended Wednesday's virtual fundraiser, which raised more than $100,000.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, a headliner at the fundraiser, argued that his party was experiencing a \"generational shift\" in its approach to housing. He's called Harris \"the first presidential nominee in at least a generation that cares about housing.\" Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado similarly described Harris at the event as \"the most pro-housing president in the history of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want somebody that is actually going to work to solve the problem of the housing shortage,\" Schatz said. \"And the simplest way to solve the problem of the housing shortage is to make it permissible for people to build as much housing as they can, especially for working people.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, a 46-year-old California Democrat who's been one of the loudest urbanist voices in Congress, noted in his remarks during the fundraiser that he was organizing the first YIMBY congressional caucus.\n\nThe fact that housing policy is high on the list of national Democratic priorities indicates how severe the affordability crisis has gotten. Harris, Obama, and other top Democrats aren't suddenly YIMBY converts \u2014 they're talking about the housing shortage because Americans are more worried about it. In a recent survey , 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans said they thought a lack of affordable housing was a significant problem.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't said much on the campaign trail about housing, though he and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have argued they could solve the supply shortage by deporting millions of immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral speakers at the YIMBY fundraiser argued that, despite being the anti-regulation party, Republicans had embraced red tape that limits what can be built and where. In the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 agenda, Ben Carson, who was Trump's secretary of housing and urban development, wrote that Republicans should \"oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning.\""

This has made the app a favorite tool for far-right extremist groups, terrorist organizations and criminal gangs. Investigators say Durov failed to cooperate with them, which would have helped them shut down the illegal operations. He is now under judicial supervision and banned from leaving French territory.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump shared a TikTok video yesterday including footage that likely violates federal law against using military cemeteries for campaigning purposes.

Maintaining voter rolls is a critical election safeguard and federal law says it can\u2019t happen within 90 days of an election.

There are people who are famous because they are important \u2014 think presidents.

            "headline": "What's Your 'Sleep Language'? Here Are the 5 Different Types and How to Speak Yours",
            "text": "There's a reason why experts suggest adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. From preventing forgetfulness to impacting your life expectancy, there's a laundry list of health reasons you should be getting quality sleep each night. However, reaching that goal isn't always easy. It can be difficult to find the correct code of hacks to unlock your sleep potential and get the rest your body needs.\n\nShelby Harris, a clinical sleep psychologist, is aiming to crack that code through partnership with the popular meditation app and mental health brand Calm. Harris and Calm have published a working understanding of the \"five sleep languages\" -- a sectioning off of a few different sleeping patterns (or lack thereof) to give people more actionable steps to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNET\n\nHarris said she came up with the five different sleep languages after considering differences among her patients over her 20 years of experience and noticing that there are a handful of categories they tend to fall into.\n\n\"We can give people a whole list of sleep hygiene targets to follow or when they should see a sleep doctor, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming for people,\" Harris said. The goal of the different sleep languages is to meet people where they are in their sleep health journey.\n\n\"It helps to guide where they want to go with what they can start with.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about your sleep language and how to use this knowledge to improve your sleep. For more advice on how to improve your sleep quality, here are eight ways to promote sleepiness and how your diet is linked to your sleep.\n\nThe 5 sleep languages and tips for speaking yours\n\nHarris has landed on five sleep languages, but it's important to note you can switch between them throughout your lifetime, she says.\n\nBelow are the five sleep languages, as described in Calm's blog.\n\n1. The 'gifted' sleeper\n\nIf you're a gifted sleeper, you probably appear to the people around you just as that -- gifted, in the name of sleep. Maybe you can fall asleep anywhere, no matter the noise or background light, or you have no problem napping. Any way you slice it, the gifted sleeper typically doesn't have a problem falling or staying asleep.\n\nTips for the gifted sleeper\n\nWhile this may seem like the \"best\" sleep language category to belong to, objectively speaking, gifted sleepers might want to see a sleep doctor if they're sleeping too much, as it could be a sign of a health condition. It can be especially important to follow up with a doctor if you're sleeping a lot but still not feeling well rested.\n\nBut if there isn't something else at play, consider whether you're actually playing catchup on sleep deprivation and whether you can benefit from a stricter sleep routine, according to the Calm post.\n\n2. The 'words of worry' sleeper\n\nIf you're a \"words of worry\" sleeper, you might know who you are. Your brain is loud at night, clouded with the \"what ifs\" of the day, and what you have to get done tomorrow. Whether it be the past or the present, a words of worry sleeper is focused on another time other than the present and the physical focus at hand: sleep.\n\nTips those who worry about sleep\n\n\"I have a lot of patients that come to me where their brains just won't turn off,\" Harris said. If you can relate to this, be clear on your sleep boundaries and limit things like screen time, or cross-contaminating nonsleep activities in the bedroom, like work. You may also benefit from adding a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation to your day, or trying this CNET to-do list hack for better sleep.\n\nWorking or scrolling in bed is a no-go when you're looking to improve your sleep. Skaman306/Getty Images\n\n3. The 'routine perfectionist' sleeper\n\nIf you're a perfectionist sleeper, you may have followed our sleep advice a little too hard to the detriment of your happiness, and sometimes, your sleep. You may be a perfectionist sleeper if you find yourself missing out on fun events, or other special occasions that may be important to you, over fear of having one night of poor sleep. Or when something or someone throws your sleep off, you're irritated.\n\n\"Those people I often see because they used to be a words of worry person or have some type of sleep issue, that then they became hyperobsessed with it,\" Harris said.\n\nTips for those a little too perfect about sleep\n\nAs laid out in the Calm blog, perfectionist sleepers will benefit from a little more flexibility and switching things up -- things that will create \"less attachment\" to your sleep routine. To get started, move around the order of your sleep routine slightly (maybe you'll brush your teeth before you put on your pajamas today, for example).\n\nLike the other sleep languages, a perfect sleeper may benefit from practicing mindfulness, which can improve your ability to relate to anxiety-inducing thoughts in a way that's not so stressful.\n\n4. The 'too hot to handle' sleeper\n\nIt's in the name, but if you're too hot to handle, you're too hot to sleep. Menopause, perimenopause, other health conditions or even a mismatched bed partner with a different internal temperature can make you too hot to handle.\n\nTips for sleep hotties\n\nIf you're waking up drenched in sweat, or you're finding yourself frequently uncomfortable at night, check in with your doctor to see what underlying health condition may be at play. Medication side effects or hormonal changes can also influence how warm you feel at night, as the Calm post points out.\n\nBut if your bed partner is the culprit, follow this CNET tip and consider getting two separate blankets or comforters, which can also cut down on blanket tug-of-war.\n\n5. The 'light as a feather' sleeper\n\nLight sleepers wake up easily from noise, light or even a strong smell. If you're light as a feather, you might wake up in the morning after a solid seven or eight hours on the pillow still feeling unrested or sleepy.\n\nTips for those light as a feather\n\nIf you're restless and not getting the quality of sleep you want, consider sharpening your bedtime routine and adding a bit more structure -- including setting those bed boundaries, like not scrolling through social media or eating in your bed. (Loose crumbs itching your bare legs may be the last thing a light sleeper needs.)\n\nCalm and Harris also suggest reaching out to a sleep professional if you're concerned about the quality of your rest, screening for sleep conditions such as sleep talking, grinding teeth and sleep apnea.\n\nD3sign/Getty Images\n\nThe link between mental health and sleep\n\nHarris says she decided to partner with Calm in response to the current mental health crisis. The pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of anxiety, eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Mental health can be improved or harmed by someone's sleep patterns.\n\nSleep deprivation, in particular, can affect your ability to stay in control of your emotions or come up with solutions to seemingly not-so-complicated problems that can feel like the end of the world when you're sleep-deprived. (I asked Harris if there was any truth to my feeling like I regress to a child's ability to handle emotions when I'm sleep-deprived, and she explained that sleep deprivation disrupts the part of our mind responsible for reasoning and judgment, and our ability to toggle between states, or our cognitive flexibility.)\n\n\"With sleep deprivation in general, we find higher rates of anxiety, higher rates of depression, higher rates of stress,\" she said. \"And we find their stress tolerance and ability to cope with daily stressors becomes much more difficult.\"\n\nThe critical component is REM sleep, which you may be deficient in if you're regularly lacking sleep. This could lead to problems in your relationship or at work.\n\n\"REM sleep is really important for emotion processing, memories,\" Harris said. \"If you're waking up early or you're not getting enough REM sleep routinely, you're gonna have trouble with irritability, depression, anxiety, all that jazz.\"\n\nAnother bottom line on good sleep\n\nDespite the number of times we preach the health benefits of sleep, there's a thread in society that may be pushing back against the idea that healthy sleep trumps all. But according to Harris, \"No pun intended, you're living in a dream world a little bit,\" if you're trying to check off everything else on the wellness list before you start prioritizing sleep. Centering sleep will help you stabilize and prioritize all the other tasks you have during the day.\n\n\"We have to stop the hamster wheel somewhere, and if you stop it by prioritizing sleep, it makes the daytime run smoother.\""

            "headline": "How Beau Biden Set the Stage For Kamala Harris\u2019 Stunning Political Rise",
            "text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere were days the pair talked to each other more than they spoke to the people who slept under their roofs.\n\nKamala Harris was the state attorney general of California and Beau Biden was in the same role over in Delaware, where so many of the banks she was fighting were based. At the height of the clean-up from the 2008 financial crisis, more than a million California households caught up in the foreclosure wave were struggling to stay in their homes. For Harris to help any of them, she needed backup from Biden, who had oversight over Wilmington, Del., the banking industry's stealth capital. That partnership helped Harris emerge as one of the only political leaders in the country seen as holding bankers accountable for predatory practices.\n\nBeau Biden had Harris\u2019 flank until the end of his too-brief life, which ended in 2015 at age 46. Five years later, the man Beau called \u201cPop\u201d tapped Harris as his running mate, creating one of the most unlikely partnerships in Democratic politics. And when President Joe Biden decided to forgo the nomination this year and clear the way for Harris, it was the dividend on an accidental alliance forged in the early 2010s when two rising stars of the Democratic Party aligned and, to the point it\u2019s become canon, actually became sincere friends.\n\nBeau Biden was atop Harris\u2019 mind last month when she accepted the elder Biden\u2019s endorsement to be the next President. \u201cI first came to know President Biden through his son, Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe\u2019s leadership as President.\u201d\n\nTrite? Sure. But it has the benefit of also happening to be true.\n\nUp until Beau Biden\u2019s death, Joe Biden long believed his son had the potential to surpass his own impressive political career. So when the elder Biden tapped Harris four years ago this month, it was in no small measure based on her true friendship with the younger Biden. As I wrote at the time, one question hung over his deliberation more than any other: What Would Beau Do? That\u2019s how Biden got to yes on Harris, despite his primary rivalry with her and a skepticism that she actually believed in the vision for America she was pitching in her own White House run.\n\n\u201cI first met Kamala through my son Beau,\u201d Biden said during his roll-out of Harris. \u201cHe had enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one\u2019s opinion I valued more than Beau\u2019s, and I\u2019m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Joe Biden stood aside to give Harris her best shot to date at winning the top job in global politics. In ways great and small, it was a moment set up by Beau Biden, who in the aughts connected with his colleague in California and decided they\u2019d be great partners\u2014and, perhaps, the future of their shared Democratic Party. One succumbed to brain cancer and the other is currently leading Donald Trump in most national polls. What started as a check on banking overreach now stands to be the driving force behind Democratic politics. And, from the outside, it looks like a not entirely bad level of match-making.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter."

            "text": "After major police endorsement, Rep. Gallego faces backlash from progressive groups\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nAfter drawing praise for an endorsement by Arizona police, Rep. Ruben Gallego has now drawn anger and disappointment from some Arizona progressives for discouraging the Department of Justice from imposing federal oversight on the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department \u2014 sent one day after the Arizona Police Association announced it\u2019s backing Gallego in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race \u2014 the congressman said federal investigators \u201cmissed the mark\u201d in their examination of Phoenix police.\n\nThat nearly three-year investigation concluded in June that Phoenix police have engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of using excessive force, acting with bias and violating constitutional and civil rights.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn his letter, Gallego described those violations \u2013 \u201ca mere 120 or so unspecified incidents across eight years,\u201d he wrote \u2013 as isolated, not pervasive. And he argued against the need for federal oversight for the city\u2019s police department, a position aligned with some of the Phoenix City Council members, who\u2019ve resisted calls from community groups for the DOJ\u2019s further involvement.\n\nPhoenix police and city officials \u201calready welcome reforms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOversight, Gallego wrote, would be best left to local government.\n\n\n\nPolice back \u2018a freaking loser\u2019\n\nWhen it was announced Monday, the Arizona Police Association\u2019s endorsement was a coup for Gallego\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe APA describes itself as an umbrella organization \u2013 \u201can association of associations\u201d \u2013 that brings together various law enforcement entities from across the state. In doing so, they represent thousands of law enforcement officers in Arizona.\n\nThe week prior, APA President Justin Harris had joined Donald Trump onstage at a rally in Glendale to announce the organization\u2019s support of the former president \u2013 someone who Harris said could get our country \u201cback on track and make America great again.\u201d\n\nAlso onstage that day, Trump described Gallego as \u201ca freaking loser.\u201d\n\nDays later, the APA endorsed that \u201closer\u201d \u2013 \u201ca Marine combat veteran\u201d who \u201cunderstands the complexities of modern policing in American society today,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe APA does not take our endorsements lightly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe recognize the importance of having a U.S. senator that can bring people together to improve society for all. We believe Congressman Gallego will be that U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an endorsement that should come in handy as Gallego defends his record from the Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee, Kari Lake, who the APA endorsed for governor in 2022.\n\nWhile a Lake spokesperson accused Gallego of supporting the defunding of police, Harris praised the congressman for backing federal legislation to boost hiring and retention of police officers.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gallego has continually fought for robust, increased funding for America\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Just lost my vote\u2019\n\nGallego\u2019s letter stunned Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona.\n\n\u201cTo act as if (the DOJ\u2019s report) is in some way not accurately reflective of \u2013 detailing the significant problems with the Phoenix Police Department, is simply not true,\u201d Keenan said.\n\nThe timing of the letter, immediately following the endorsement of the state\u2019s largest independent law enforcement organization, made it worse, he said.\n\n\u201cIt seems very transactional,\u201d Keenan said.\n\n\u201cA lot of city officials and Rep. Gallego, they speak about public safety,\u201d he added. \u201cBut true public safety cannot ignore constitutional rights. It cannot ignore the violence perpetrated by the Phoenix Police Department on members of our community. And to issue statements like this is, frankly, dangerous, because it will embolden the police not to reform themselves.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Poder In Action, a community group that routinely lodges complaints about police treatment of Black, brown and Indigenous communities, called the claims in the letter \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to the communities Gallego represents in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is really just ridiculous to, after all of this evidence, to say that this department can change itself,\u201d executive director Viri Hernandez said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHernandez also said she wasn\u2019t shocked Gallego\u2019s letter came on the heels of the APA endorsement.\n\n\u201cOur community sees the way that police unions, when they support candidates, most of the time \u2014 every example we\u2019ve seen \u2014 also leads to those candidates pushing back against accountability, transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether the police endorsement was tied to the DOJ letter, a spokesperson for the Gallego campaign says there was \u201cno agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuben Gallego has a record of fighting for Arizona\u2019s law enforcement in Congress and is proud to have the support of the Arizona Police Association,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nPoder In Action isn\u2019t in the business of endorsing candidates. As a 501(c)3, they\u2019re barred from intervening in political campaigns. \u201cOur focus is to expose the discrepancies, the lies from any party \u2013 Democrats or Republicans,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell folks who to vote for, who to not vote for,\u201d she added.\n\nNeither does the ACLU of Arizona. But personally, Keenan didn\u2019t mince words when he first responded to the letter on X."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris\u2019s Gamble",
            "text": "In the first month of Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s improbable run for President, she allowed Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm about finally having a credible opponent to Donald Trump to define her candidacy. Once Joe Biden left the race and Harris let her intentions be known, the excitement vastly outweighed the need to know precisely what policies she was running on. Tens of thousands of people joined Zoom calls to raise funds and created networks aimed at supporting the Vice-President\u2019s run. Thousands more stood in line for hours to pack arenas for rallies, which became staging grounds for crafting the themes of her developing campaign.\n\nAt those rallies, the framing of her campaign came into focus. Harris adhered to typical liberal fare: raising the minimum wage and providing affordable housing and health care. She has been more pointed in her intentions to fight for abortion rights and to extend protections and rights to L.G.B.T.Q. people. By choosing as her running mate the genuinely populist governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, over the more moderate Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, Harris delighted progressives.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nBut the most excitement about Harris\u2019s surprise candidacy has been generated without her having to say a word. Her presence at the top of the ticket, as a biracial woman and the daughter of two immigrant parents, has served as a backlash to the backlash against 2020\u2019s national reckoning with the history of American racism. Even as Harris and Walz have deftly avoided any mention of race or racism in this contest, its centrality to the looming election is undeniable.\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party\u2019s long campaign to end affirmative action was finally realized by a U.S. Supreme Court packed with Trump appointees. Books about slavery and racism against African Americans and school curricula teaching Black history have been banned in some states and localities. In Florida, in an effort that has since been challenged in court but which captured the national mood, Republican legislators passed the so-called Stop WOKE Act, which tried to manage the teaching of Black history based on whether it was perceived to make white students feel guilty. Universities in states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Utah have closed centers and offices dedicated to diversity.\n\nSince Harris became the presumptive nominee, Trump has attacked her racial identity, intentionally mispronounced her name, and questioned her intelligence, going so far as to call her \u201cdumb.\u201d His running mate, J. D. Vance, has supported a national ban on abortion and described people without children as inferior to parents. Under these circumstances, supporting Harris can feel like an act of resistance.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention provided Harris with the opportunity to spell out the specifics of why she should be promoted to President. It was organized to project a new image of Harris as tough and, as her husband, Doug Emhoff, put it, \u201cready to lead.\u201d Democrats seized the opportunity to claim they were charting a new course for the country, emphasizing themes of joy and patriotism; the crowd periodically broke out into chants of \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d Love of country was laced throughout the speeches, in contrast to Trump\u2019s regular descriptions of the U.S. as a hellscape that only he can rescue. As Michelle Obama intoned, Harris \u201ctruly understands\u201d what has \u201calways made America great.\u201d The emotive goals of the Convention seemed to have been met, but what of the opportunity to map out the meaning of a Harris Presidency?\n\nFor all the talk about moving forward, the Democratic Party decided to feature the parts of its past that most troubled its core constituencies of Black and young voters. Bill Clinton made his mark on the Party by championing a turn away from social welfare and civil rights. His legacy includes policies that fuelled mass incarceration and demonized poor Black people, especially Black women, whom he made the focal point of his efforts to abolish welfare as an entitlement. During her campaign for the Presidency in 2016, Hillary Clinton was hounded by Black Lives Matter activists for referring to juveniles in 1996 as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Barack Obama may be adored by many, but it was under his Administration that Occupy Wall Street and the Black Lives Matter movement erupted, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises of his historic run for office.\n\nThat the Party featured the old guard while still claiming a new path reflected the tensions throughout the Convention: joy alongside Harris\u2019s bellicose promise of pursuing American values abroad with \u201cthe strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\u201d; challenges to misogyny and promotion of different kinds of family, but no concrete details on how Harris would address the crisis in child-care costs and the rising costs of living. The Convention featured four of the wrongly convicted, and since exonerated, Central Park Five before a segment that celebrated Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor. Most pointedly, speakers repeatedly framed the election as a struggle for democracy and a fight for freedom, yet the D.N.C. refused to give a single Palestinian American any time on the main stage. The refusal was in contrast to the Convention\u2019s parade of Republicans, who were given speaking slots because they rejected Trump.\n\nThese conflicting messages seemed intended to inspire and embolden the base while also reaching voters who have not yet made up their minds. This dual purpose left Harris ill-equipped to speak about how she and her party plan to address the central issues of the election, including the hardships driven by economic inequality and inflation. Instead, she offered vague platitudes, promising an \u201copportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed.\u201d Harris pledged to \u201cend\u201d the housing shortage, with no details of how she would do it. There was almost no attempt to address the social questions that so sharply defined the 2020 race, when Harris was selected as Vice-President. Then, Harris decried \u201cstructural racism,\u201d injustice in our criminal-justice system, and \u201cexcessive use of force by police.\u201d In sum, she concluded, \u201cthere is no vaccine for racism. We\u2019ve gotta do the work.\u201d The new Democratic Party platform also featured this dramatic shift, burying the fight for racial justice of 2020. For the first time since 2012, the Party\u2019s platform does not oppose the death penalty; it calls for more police, without emphasizing police reform.\n\nTo be sure, much has changed since 2020. But Harris is gambling that the millions of people who marched in search of resolution to the crisis of racism that year will simply move forward on this well-trodden path to the future. The Democratic Party is gambling that the nomination of a Black and Indian woman alone will satisfy the desires for racial justice. It is a risky strategy. The G.O.P. is prepared to flood the airwaves with an assortment of comments that Harris has made that will validate the \u201cliberal\u201d label. As one G.O.P. strategist put it, \u201cThe archive is deep.\u201d In Harris\u2019s previous run for President, she supported universal health care and free tuition for students at public colleges and universities. She raised the possibility of \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She opposed fracking and called for an end to juvenile incarceration.\n\nEven though Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren are among the most popular Democrats in the country, and an unabashed strategy of leveraging public dollars to rebuild the U.S. economy and promising to address racial discrimination produced one of the largest voter turnouts in American history, Harris and the Party leadership have acquiesced to the terms of the Republican backlash and rejected anything having to do with the successful 2020 election. Instead of explaining why she has supported these positions, in hopes of persuading an electorate desperate for change and possibly open to her reasoning, Harris is trying to reinvent herself on the fly."

            "headline": "U.S. Army Confirms Trump Staffer \u2018Pushed\u2019 Arlington Staffer Before Filming TikTok Ad",
            "text": "Donald Trump is facing new questions on Thursday about a stunt the former president filmed at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week. Photos of the 45th president giving a big thumbs up were the first to surface in an incredibly tacky, if typical, move for Trump. But new revelations from that day have been trickling out, including allegations of a physical altercation between Trump\u2019s staff and a staff member at Arlington, as well as the fact that Trump likely broke federal law while filming the ad at the cemetery.\n\nIt all started Monday when Trump appeared at Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony wreath for 13 U.S. military service members killed at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan during the American withdrawal in 2021. Federal regulations prohibit the filming of campaign commercials and the production of publicity material, but Trump brought along a crew to document his little stunt.\n\nAs the New York Times points out, Trump was in a heavily restricted part of the cemetery known as Section 60, which is primarily for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a staff member at Arlington approached his camera crew. There was a physical altercation, with Trump\u2019s staff insisting they should be allowed to film in the restricted area for their stupid little commercial.\n\nThe Arlington staff member has reportedly declined to press charges against Trump because it \u201ccould subject her to retaliation from Trump supporters,\u201d as the Times reports. And that\u2019s a reasonable fear, given the fact that Trump is the guy who tried to literally overthrow the U.S. government on January 6, 2021, and his followers are some of the most violent extremists around.\n\nThe Trump camp has tried to play down the incident and campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even slandered the Arlington staff member as mentally unstable on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump\u2019s team during a very solemn ceremony,\u201d Cheung told NPR.\n\nCheung added to NPR, \u201cWe are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made.\u201d But no footage showing details of the physical altercation has been released yet and NPR writes that when a reporter asked to see the footage, the Trump campaign declined.\n\nThe Army released a new statement about the incident on Thursday to defend the unnamed staff member at Arlington (ANC), who was simply trying to enforce the rules.\n\n\u201cParticipants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\u201d an unnamed Army spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation\u2019s fallen deserve,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe Trump campaign has released several staged videos from that day, and Trump himself says in one of the videos he\u2019s churned out for social media that, \u201cWe lost 13 people great, great people, what a horrible day it was,\u201d referring to the last day U.S. forces were officially in Afghanistan under wartime conditions. And then Trump insisted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose one person in 18 months and then they took over that disaster of leaving Afghanistan.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true, of course. The Associated Press fact-checked his claim back in 2022 and reported there was no 18-month period during his presidency without casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nBut all of that is really beside the point. Trump clearly broke the law by trying this idiotic move at a place widely revered as a site of quiet contemplation. As he does with everything, Trump turned it into a circus all about himself.\n\nThe law Trump broke by filming at the cemetery is 32 CFR \u00a7 553.32, according to the Washington Post, which prohibits any politician from engaging in political activity at the site. The newspaper talked with legal experts who emphatically explained that \u201cif the campaign was filming during the wreath-laying ceremony for partisan political activities, that would be a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked later in the day Thursday about the incident by NBC News reporter Dasha Burns. Incredibly, the former president played dumb, insisting \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about\u201d the TikTok video his team pushed out. That\u2019s obviously a lie. Trump then went on to say \u201cwe\u2019re leading the internet,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re so far above her on the internet,\u201d which are rather funny ways to talk about online spaces.\n\nBut the weirdest answer in his litany of untrue statements was the suggestion that the entire incident was somehow manufactured by his political opponents.\n\n\u201cThis was a set-up by the people in the administration, that, \u2018oh, Trump is coming to Arlington, that looks so bad for us\u2019,\u201d Trump said.\n\n@msnbc Former President Donald Trump defends his appearance at Arlington National Cemetery in an interview with @nbcnews Dasha Burns. During the interview, Trump suggests that someone outside his team might have been responsible for the video captured during his visit, despite it being posted on his campaign\u2019s TikTok account. @katiephang reacts. \u266c original sound \u2013 MSNBC \u2013 MSNBC\n\nTrump is struggling in the national polls, as he and Kamala Harris have just a little over two months before Election Day. And it\u2019s clear that Trump will do anything he can\u2014including breaking federal law\u2014in a desperate bid to retake power. With any luck, the former president will fail in those efforts. But things could get a lot weirder before they get any better on November 8."

Jetzt deutete er einen Sexskandal an.\n\nDonald Trump versucht weiter, mit derben Kommentaren die Aufmerksamkeit im US-Wahlkampf auf sich zu ziehen. Auf der von ihm mitbegr\u00fcndeten Plattform \"Truth Social\" waren Andeutungen zu lesen, wonach sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten die politische Karriere von Kamala Harris bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten.\n\nAnspielungen auf Sex-Skandal von Bill Clinton\n\nIn dem Post des republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Harris zu sehen, auf dem sie neben der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton steht. Dazu der Kommentar: \"Lustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben ...\"\n\nDie Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sexskandal, in den Clintons Mann und Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 bis 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Die Andeutungen sind in dem Post nicht mit Quellen belegt, werden aber dennoch von Trump-Anh\u00e4ngern geteilt.\n\nTrump verfasste den Beitrag nicht selbst. Dass er ihn auf seinem offiziellen Truth-Social-Account verbreitete, ist dennoch bemerkenswert. Der Republikaner verunglimpft seine demokratische Gegnerin im Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Unter anderem bezeichnet er sie als \"verr\u00fcckt\" und \"dumm\".\n\nTrump hat Harris auch schon mit Blick auf ihre Hautfarbe und Herkunft attackiert und unter anderem behauptet, die 59-J\u00e4hrige sei \"vor einigen Jahren pl\u00f6tzlich schwarz\" geworden. Verbale Angriffe sexueller Art haben eine neue Qualit\u00e4t.\n\nBei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Chicago kommentierte Trump die Hautfarbe von Kamala Harris.\n\nImmer wieder pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe - trotz Mahnungen\n\nMehrere Republikaner hatten Trump zuletzt \u00f6ffentlich dazu geraten, weniger pers\u00f6nliche Attacken gegen Harris von sich zu geben, sondern mehr inhaltliche Punkte zu machen. Trump wurde k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Pressekonferenz auf diese Mahnungen angesprochen, tat solche Ratschl\u00e4ge jedoch ab.\n\n\"Ich glaube, ich habe ein Recht darauf, sie pers\u00f6nlich zu attackieren\", sagte der 78-J\u00e4hrige mit Blick auf Harris und den Wahlkampf und schob nach: \"Ich muss es auf meine Art machen.\"\n\nSchon im Wahlkampf 2016 hatte Trump mit einer vulg\u00e4ren Aussage f\u00fcr Furore gesorgt, dass er Frauen \u00fcberall anfassen k\u00f6nne, auch zwischen den Beinen. Die Amerikaner w\u00e4hlten ihn damals trotzdem zum Pr\u00e4sidenten."

            "headline": "Ahead of key interview, five questions Kamala Harris hasn\u2019t answered yet",
            "text": "From the Gaza war to immigration to inflation, Harris is yet to spell out how she will accomplish her agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris will sit down for her first major broadcast interview since she became the face of the Democratic Party following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nShe will be joined by her running mate, Tim Walz, for the interview with CNN.\n\nUntil now, Harris has taken a cautious approach towards the press, much like Biden, who has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than any of the past seven US presidents, Axios reported, citing presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar.\n\nHarris\u2019s own sparse engagement with the media has come under scrutiny, especially from the Republicans. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to do a news conference; she\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Republican challenger Donald Trump said during a news conference of his own on August 15.\n\nTo be sure, Harris has spoken on several key issues that polls suggest matter to American voters, in campaign rallies and policy speeches. But without the cross-questioning that an interview allows, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee\u2019s positions on critical subjects remain ambiguous.\n\nSo when is the interview and what are some of the questions Harris has yet to clearly answer?\n\nWhen is Harris\u2019s CNN interview?\n\nHarris will speak to CNN\u2019s anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash alongside the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, at 9pm (01:00 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t be silent\u2019 on Gaza: How will she speak up?\n\nOn July 26, following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, Harris pledged not to stay silent on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,\u201d she told reporters. Yet, simultaneously, she pledged unwavering commitment to Israel.\n\n''I have had an unwavering commitment to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel.'' US VP Kamala Harris says she expressed her 'serious concerns' to Israeli PM Netanyahu about the 'scale of human suffering in Gaza.' pic.twitter.com/1U0KErqiDL \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 26, 2024\n\nIn the month since she made this statement, however, Harris\u2019s relative silence on Gaza has come under fire from critics who have questioned whether Harris\u2019s policy on Israel\u2019s war will be any different from Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo far, the answer, many believe, seems to be a firm no.\n\nAmid speculation that she might at least consider using restrictions on arms sales to Israel as leverage to convince the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop massacres of Palestinians, her adviser on national security made clear that Harris had no such plans.\n\n\u201cShe does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\u201d Phil Gordon, the adviser, said on August 8.\n\n.@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law. \u2014 Phil Gordon (@PhilGordon46) August 8, 2024\n\nAt this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which was held from August 19 to August 22 in Chicago, Harris once again simultaneously pledged support for Israel and expressed sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the Democrats refused to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the convention, while the parents of an Israeli-American captive held in Gaza were allowed to take the stage.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters rallied outside the DNC venue on all three days but were blocked from marching too close to the venue by police. Many warned that they would not support Harris in the November vote unless she ends unconditional support for Israel.\n\nHow will she ban \u2018price gouging\u2019?\n\nOn August 16, Harris proposed a ban on \u201cprice gouging\u201d by food suppliers and grocery stores.\n\nPrice gouging refers to dramatically raising prices to \u201cunfair levels\u201d in response to short-term high demand or scarcity \u2013 often following disasters, such as flooding. While several states already restrict the practice for some goods considered essential, there is no federal law barring it.\n\nThe proposal could be popular. High grocery bill inflation is a key concern for many voters. Under Biden\u2019s administration, grocery prices have gone up by 21 percent as part of an inflation surge.\n\nBut Harris has not spelt out how exactly she would go about enacting this ban on price gouging, earning her backlash from political critics, as well as industry.\n\nIn a release last week, the Trump campaign called her plan an example of \u201ccommunist price controls\u201d.\n\nIndustrialists and economists also said the plan could do more harm than good.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan is vague, but a central part of it involves getting the US Congress to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging in food and grocery sectors, similar to legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last year.\n\nYet political analysts point out that such legislation has almost no chance of passing in Congress \u2014 raising questions about the sincerity of Harris\u2019s proposal.\n\nWill she build a border wall?\n\nHarris has flip-flopped on the topic of immigration.\n\nDuring the DNC, she pledged that she would sign the now-defunct bipartisan border security bill that Trump wanted to terminate out of fears that it would benefit Democrats.\n\nThis bill would have allocated $20m towards security measures at the southern border with Mexico. The bill also set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for the construction of a border wall that was a signature project undertaken by Trump, and criticised by many Democrats.\n\nIndeed, during Trump\u2019s administration, Harris had called the idea of the wall \u201cun-American\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, she wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won\u2019t make us any safer.\u201d\n\nWhen she declared her candidacy for her 2020 presidential race in 2019, she called the wall Trump\u2019s \u201cmedieval vanity project\u201d.\n\nBesides pledging support for the bill that funds the wall, there are other indicators of Harris\u2019s hardening stance on immigration, including campaign advertisements in which she supports the idea of more Border Patrol agents.\n\nThis shift comes amid efforts by Republicans to hold Harris responsible for a surge in undocumented migrants into the US, by describing her as Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nNEW AD: On the border, the choice is simple. Kamala Harris is fighting to fix our broken immigration system. Donald Trump is trying to stop her. pic.twitter.com/t200w8iAYv \u2014 Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 30, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s her position on Medicare for All?\n\nWhen Harris was a senator for California, she signed on as a co-sponsor for Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All legislation which called for a single-payer health insurance system to provide everyone in the US with comprehensive healthcare.\n\nHowever, Harris\u2019s economic plan this time is silent on Medicare for All. So, it is unclear if she still backs the idea or has dropped it entirely.\n\nWill Harris ban fracking?\n\nDuring her 2019 primary run, Harris had also pledged to ban fracking \u2013 the controversial technique of extracting oil and gas from shale rock by drilling the earth.\n\nThe practice causes earth tremors and has a high environmental cost since the procedure consumes large amounts of water, in addition to releasing methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nHowever, Harris seems to have taken a U-turn on fracking during her presidential campaign this year. In late July, her campaign officials confirmed that she will not seek to ban fracking if elected.\n\nTrump had invoked her 2019 anti-fracking stance to criticise her.\n\nThe Biden administration allowed fracking. Harris herself has not made a public statement about whether or not she will ban fracking if she rises to the top job."

No economist on earth will support it, strategist says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the U.S., and implementing his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports would make inflation surge, according to a Nobel-prize winning economist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Trump were actually able to get his agenda through, it would be a disaster,\u201d Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Bill Clinton, told Quartz in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStiglitz, who more recently was head of the International Economic Association, said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201chas been a very steady hand with a set of well-talked-through proposals from the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrump every other day changes his mind about something,\u201d Stiglitz said, arguing that Trump\u2019s planned 50% tariffs on Chinese goods would slam lower- and middle-income Americans. \u201cThose tariffs would create a significant increase in the cost of living, it would be a shock to the economy, and that inflation, in turn, would lead the Fed to raise interest rates.\u201d\n\nReducing America\u2019s dependence on China can\u2019t be done with a sledgehammer, Stiglitz said. \u201cThe Biden-Harris proposal for a 10% tariff is an important signal to the market: \u2018You\u2019d better think about diversifying your supply chain.\u2019 And that, I would call good economic management. Good economic policy is balancing multiple concerns, and that kind of balancing is what distinguishes Harris from Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the specifics of Harris\u2019 plans, from boosting the child tax credit to planning to build three million new homes, Stiglitz said \u201cthe bundle as a whole is moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThose are cumulative problems that have been unattended for 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand so you\u2019re not going to be able to solve them overnight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 plans would also address the growth of monopolies, which have been holding back U.S. innovation and driving prices higher, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the weaknesses in the U.S. economy over the past 20 years has been a significant growth in market power, and that increase in market power reduces innovation, increases inequality, and lowers real wages of ordinary Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been one aspect of [the Biden-Harris] economic policy that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Trump and Harris lies in their tax policies.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 [Trump tax cut] was an enormous tax cut for the millionaires, and actually a tax increase when it was fully implemented for a large fraction of Americans,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWhat we need to do is restore tax justice, increase the taxes on the billionaires who can obviously afford it, and help address some of the big problems of inequality that we have, like child poverty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s move to cut the corporate income tax from 28% to to 21% did nothing to improve U.S. competitiveness, it just increased stock buybacks, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cExtending [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and making them deeper would make a huge hole in the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, the reason why they expired in 2025 was because the deficit created by the tax bill was so large that even Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe irony of his policies is that while a lot of support for them may come from people who feel like the system has left them behind,\u201d Siglitz added, \u201chis proposal will leave them even more behind.\u201d"

            "text": "The official J.D. Vance Bad Press Tour keeps on rolling this week, as the Republican vice presidential hopeful faces scrutiny over 2021 comments he made bashing teachers without biological children, including American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten.\n\nAlready grappling with widespread backlash over another 2021 jab calling Democratic politicians and voters \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d Vance now must answer more questions about further comments he made during an October 2021 political event for the Center for Christian Virtue. \u201cSo many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they\u2019re people without kids trying to brainwash the minds of our children. That really disorients me and disturbs me,\u201d Vance said during the event. \u201cRandi Weingarten, who\u2019s the head of the most powerful teachers\u2019 union in the country, she doesn\u2019t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\u201d\n\nWeingarten is a lesbian, and introduced the public to her wife, Liz Margolies, in 2007. Vance\u2019s disparaging remarks, however, were also inaccurate: Weingarten, believed to be the first openly LGBTQ+ president of a major U.S. labor union, is stepmother to Margolies\u2019 biological children, and described herself as a \u201cmother by marriage\u201d last year when subjected to similar attacks on her motherhood by Vance\u2019s GOP colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nStill, Vance doubled down on, and falsely reframed, his own remarks while being interviewed on the tarmac outside the Trump-Vance campaign jet this week, as CNN reported. \u201cI didn\u2019t criticize Randi Weingarten for not having kids, I criticized her for wanting to brainwash mine,\u201d Vance claimed. Meanwhile, Weingarten responded in an MSNBC interview, calling his comments \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d\n\nA Viral Image Appears to Show Virulently Anti-LGBTQ+ VP Candidate J.D. Vance in Drag Content creator and podcast host Matt Bernstein posted the image to X and Instagram over the weekend.\n\nVance has not specifically stated in what way he believes Weingarten is \u201cbrainwashing\u201d his children. His statement at the Center for Christian Virtue event was made in the general context of \u201cthe ideology of the left,\u201d which Vance characterized as \u201ccontrol[ling] what our children learn.\u201d Similarly vague, yet apocalyptic, rhetoric about Weingarten and the AFT has proliferated on the right over the last several years. In a 2022 interview, former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Weingarten \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d and alleged that teachers\u2019 unions are \u201cthe most likely to take this republic down.\u201d Other Republican lines of attack have included the accusation that Weingarten and the AFT puppeteered the U.S.\u2019 COVID-19 policy, which Weingarten flatly denied and called \u201cwild allegations.\u201d"

            "headline": "Kamala\u2019s Moment",
            "text": "The Precise Time Department sounds like something from a story by Jorge Luis Borges, but it is a real subdivision of the US Navy. At the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris has her official residence, the department maintains the Master Clock with which all others in the military system are harmonized. At the end of the driveway that leads from the vice-president\u2019s house, there is a public display of these exact hours, minutes, and seconds set beside a huge ship\u2019s anchor, as though this superaccurate chronometer served to hold America steady and prevent it from coming unmoored. Such reassurance seems, of course, ever more illusory.\n\nThere is a melancholy evocation of the Master Clock and its merciless motions at the start of Promise Me, Dad (2017), Joe Biden\u2019s account of his public and private lives in 2014. Biden was then living at the Naval Observatory as vice-president to Barack Obama. Leaving the residence for his family\u2019s annual Thanksgiving gathering in Nantucket, he seemed momentarily mesmerized:\n\nI glanced at the squat, standing digital clock at the top of the driveway, as I had maybe a thousand times since we had moved into the official residence. Red numbers glowed, ticking away in metronomic perfection: 5:11:42, 5:11:43, 5:11:44, 5:11:45\u2026. Precise Time\u2014synchronized to the millisecond\u2014had been deemed an operational imperative by the Department of Defense, which had troops and bases in locations around the globe. 5:11:50, 5:11:51, 5:11:52.\n\nOur limousine was already accelerating out of the turn with an abrupt force that pushed me back into the soft leather seats. The clock was behind us in a flash, out of sight, but still marking the time as it melted away\u20145:11:58, 5:11:59, 5:12:00.\n\nFor Biden, time was melting away. He did not get to be his party\u2019s nominee for president in 2016, and that in turn meant that he would be too old to stand for a second term in 2024. Hard as he tried, he could not, in the end, escape the clock\u2019s relentless indifference to his desire to stay in power. But for Harris, the glowing red numbers that haunted Biden may mark the precise time. They have hurried her to a moment not just of personal destiny but of historic fate.\n\nHarris\u2019s rapid coronation as the Democratic candidate for the presidency is at once quite fortuitous and utterly timely. It might be called an accident that\u2019s been waiting to happen. An accident because were it not for a series of unprecedented events\u2014Biden\u2019s becoming the oldest president in US history, his disintegration in a live televised debate, Donald Trump\u2019s political resurgence after an attempted coup and personal resurrection after an attempted assassination\u2014neither she nor any other Black woman would have become the candidate of either of the two main parties. The time, in conventional wisdom, would not have been right. The voters would not have been ready. The clock would have to tick on through endless cycles before the day arrived when it would feel safe to have, at the top of the ticket, an embodiment of American power that was neither white nor male.\n\nAnd yet it was an accident waiting to happen because this conventional wisdom is itself out of sync with a nation in which white men make up just 30 percent of the population. This is the minority that benefits from a spectacular application of positive discrimination in the political sphere: it accounts for close to two thirds of officeholders. By contrast, only three Black women\u2014Shirley Chisholm in 1972, Carol Moseley Braun in 2004, and Harris in 2020\u2014have previously even sought a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and only three (including Harris) have served in the Senate. No Black woman has been elected as a governor, and only twenty-five have held other senior statewide offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, or secretary of state.\n\nTime shapes contemporary American politics in two additional ways\u2014anachronism and gerontocracy. Biden, because of who he is, seemed to embody both the superannuated nature of America\u2019s political class and its overrepresentation of white men of the baby boomer generation. Harris, because of who she is, is uniquely placed to call time on both these realities\u2014which means, first of all, calling time on Donald Trump. If she frames her campaign effectively, Harris can make Trump a throwback and herself the embodiment of a future that has already taken shape in American demography.\n\nThat campaign can and must be about the things that affect people\u2019s daily lives\u2014jobs, health care, education, the climate crisis. But ticking away underneath it is another kind of question: Who is a normal American now? Harris\u2019s choice of running mate suggests she is aware of this: the avuncular Minnesota governor Tim Walz has a gift for making progressive ideals seem familiar, ordinary, and rooted in down-home common sense. Meanwhile, Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, implicitly appeal to a more symbolic notion of representation: however complex and diverse American society might seem to be, its essential form is male, white, and at least culturally Christian. This has always been so in the past and must always be so in the future. If demography, and therefore democracy, is flowing away from this eternal truth, then democracy must be frozen in time. When Trump told a right-wing Christian audience on July 26 that if they vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d they \u201cwon\u2019t have to do it anymore,\u201d he was putting forward his own notion of the end of history. The changes that are making the US more ethnically diverse, less comfortably patriarchal, and less Christian will be permanently checked because the institutions of power will have been made safe from their effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the problem with Biden\u2019s candidacy was that, for vastly more benign reasons, it drew on a parallel idea of holding back a tide of change. Biden presented himself, not without reason, as a bulwark, the only immovable object that could stop the apparently unstoppable Trump. As the Democratic candidate, Harris has rightly taken up Biden\u2019s message that the election in November is, as the outgoing president put it in his address from the Oval Office on July 24, about \u201csaving our democracy.\u201d But her candidacy carries a much stronger resonance. It says that saving American democracy is not at all the same thing as preserving it.\n\nBiden used the metaphor made famous by John F. Kennedy when he became, at forty-three, the second-youngest president in US history: \u201cI\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\u201d But the torch of American democracy must be envisaged as a flickering flame. In her rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, Hillary Clinton spoke of how \u201cevery generation has carried the torch forward.\u201d It is not a secure and fixed inheritance that can be handed down as a bequest from one generation to the next. It is a dangerous and endangered idea that must always draw fuel from new sources. American democracy cannot be saved if it is not reimagined, deepened, expanded, and brought into line with contemporary American realities. It is open to Harris to embody the energy of that urgent updating. Indeed, she can scarcely do otherwise.\n\nIt would be good to live in a world where Harris\u2019s gender and ethnicity were irrelevant and where she was judged solely on her record and ideas. But if there is any such world, it does not include the US. Trump, Vance, and the Republican Party will not permit such a possibility. Their reactionary mindset is obsessed with human biology\u2014Harris, for them, is inescapably defined by her chromosomes. The idea of the reproduction of America through the generations is projected onto her body. So far as we know, none of the forty-five occupants to date of the Oval Office has given birth to a child\u2014but in Harris\u2019s case this nonevent is a neglect of biological duty that makes her, in Vance\u2019s words, one of the \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d who don\u2019t \u201chave a direct stake\u201d in the country\u2019s future. The point of this contention is precisely that it is a claim on the future. Tomorrow belongs to Vance and those who look and think like him.\n\nHarris does, of course, have children through her marriage to Doug Emhoff, but because she did not give birth to them, Vance cited her first among the ranks of \u201cpeople without children.\u201d This, crucially, excludes her from the norm and indeed makes her the prime example of those who \u201chate normal Americans for choosing family.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that Harris has failed to give birth; it is also that she has failed to be properly born. John Eastman, a coconspirator in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 election, sought the Republican nomination for California attorney general in 2010, the year Harris won that office. In August 2020 Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman protesting that \u201cbefore we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris\u2019 eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth.\u201d He claimed (on spurious constitutional grounds) that since (as he thought) Harris\u2019s parents were in the United States on temporary visas when she was born in October 1964, she\n\nowed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers\u2014Jamaica, in the case of her father, and India, in the case of her mother\u2014and was therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment as originally understood.\n\nAt the time Trump amplified this bogus allegation, describing Eastman as a \u201cvery highly qualified, very talented lawyer\u201d and remarking that\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI heard it today that she doesn\u2019t meet the requirements\u2026. I have no idea if that\u2019s right, I would\u2019ve\u2014I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026very serious.\n\nOn August 19, as the Democratic convention was opening, Trump returned to this theme, asking of the Democrats: \u201cI wonder if they knew where she comes from.\u201d In this upending of the idea of birthright, Harris has no right to be American because she was born wrong. If there\u2019s a genre underpinning the Republican disdain for Harris, it\u2019s a nativity play that has become a horror movie. In Eastman\u2019s narrative, she was already, at the very moment of her birth, a traitor to America, loyal to two foreign powers. According to Vance\u2019s rhetoric, this misbegotten woman has grown up to be the potential begetter of a sterile American future.\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been attacked with both these biological weapons. Barack Obama had to face down Trump\u2019s birther lies but not the other natalist assault as well. No one said he hated ordinary Americans because he had not brought his own pregnancy to term. Yet it is the very unprecedented nature of this double assault on her bodily being that also gives Harris an exceptional power. She knows how to deal with this stuff\u2014she has been doing so all her life, with considerable grace.\n\nIt seems telling that Trump has had to abandon his mocking nickname for her, Laffin\u2019 Kamala, presumably because of a belated realization that her laughter\u2014so different from his own cruel comedy\u2014seems to most people to express optimism, youthfulness, and a joy in life, all qualities that he (as well as Biden) so patently lacks. She politicizes the idea of being comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. And in that comfort, there is a paradoxical kind of potency. She can be extremely radical by presenting herself merely as what she is. For if Harris really is a \u201cnormal American\u201d (as of course she is), it can only be because the American norm has been transformed. It can be possible because the torch has already been passed not just to a new generation but to new forms of personal and collective self-definition.\n\nHarris is fluent in a kind of baby talk very different from the demented babble of the Republican assaults on her. She does not run from the politicization of her body\u2014she embraces it. She is, in the way she tells her own story, a child of struggle. In her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey (2019), the earliest memory she recounts is of \u201ca sea of legs moving about, of the energy and shouts and chants.\u201d She gives us an infant\u2019s-eye view of political activism, with her looking up from her stroller at the legs of fellow civil rights marchers. Her cutest baby anecdote is freighted with time and history: \u201cMy mother would laugh telling a story she loved about the time when I was fussing as a toddler. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 she asked, trying to soothe me. \u2018Fweedom!\u2019 I yelled back.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the only good moment in her primary campaign of 2019, Harris identified herself explicitly and indignantly as a Black child of the 1960s. She attacked Biden for his opposition to the policy of integrating school systems by busing pupils from Black families to white-dominated areas: \u201cYou know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Her campaign tweeted a picture of Harris as a little girl, her hair in pigtails tied with bows. It then produced T-shirts printed with this image and the words \u201c THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME .\u201d Childhood yarns are part of the grammar of American politics, but this one is different. It is more defiant than endearing, more confrontational than sentimental.\n\nThe image of a Black girl in pigtails has its own specific history. In 1954, just months after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found educational segregation to be unconstitutional, Scientific American published an article titled \u201cThe Biology of the Negro.\u201d It was written by Curt Stern, an influential geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley\u2014the same university to which Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had traveled from India to study nutrition and endocrinology. It followed a lecture Stern had delivered in 1946 under the title \u201cWhy Do People Differ?\u201d According to the historian of medicine Michael Yudell:\n\nThe program for the lecture pictured a cartoon with three girls, two of whom were white, one black. The local chapter of the NAACP objected to the picture of a shabbily dressed black girl in pigtails wearing boots flanked by two well-dressed white girls looking at the black girl and smiling.\n\nBut in 1964, just months before Harris was born, Look magazine published what became a famous painting by Norman Rockwell called The Problem We All Live With. It shows another little Black girl in pigtails, this time neatly dressed in all-white clothes that emphasize the color of her skin. She is six-year-old Ruby Bridges, walking determinedly to her first day at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans in 1960. Towering over her, so high that their faces are out of the frame, are four men identified by their yellow armbands as deputy US marshals. Behind Bridges is a wall splattered with the bloodred juice of a hurled tomato and graffitied in bold letters with the N-word. By inviting his viewers to see this painting as a reality \u201cwe all\u201d live with, Rockwell was saying this violence is every bit as American as his supposedly nostalgic images of a vanishing small-town way of life.\n\nWhen Harris produced her THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME T-shirts, she was invoking her own history as well as the image of Ruby Bridges. And what\u2019s striking about this is that \u201ca Norman Rockwell view of America\u201d is proverbial shorthand for a sanitized and sentimentalized version of the past. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear (2018), Trump\u2019s economic adviser Gary Cohn made this very accusation against the then president in a heated argument over the nature of contemporary America: \u201c\u2018Mr. President,\u2019 Cohn said, trying to summarize, \u2018You have a Norman Rockwell view of America.\u2019\u201d Harris, to the contrary, evokes a very different \u201cNorman Rockwell view of America,\u201d one in which racial violence and resistance are acknowledged as part of a shared reality.\n\nThe creation of \u201cthat little girl\u201d involved the making of a profound choice about American history\u2014and about its most toxic aspect: slavery. Of all the \u201cfirsts\u201d that Harris represents\u2014first female vice-president, first Black woman and first Indian American to contest the presidency\u2014the one that goes unspoken is that if she wins in November, she will be the first openly acknowledged descendant of slaves to lead America. In this identification there is a complex interplay between freedom and necessity. It can perhaps best be appreciated through the uncanny recurrence of the same Irish name in her genealogy and in Biden\u2019s: Finnegan or Finegan. It is Biden\u2019s mother\u2019s surname and a constant point of reference in his idea of who he really is. It lives on in the name of his granddaughter Finnegan. It is also the name of Harris\u2019s father\u2019s maternal grandmother, Miss Iris, a Black woman born, as he recalled in a 2020 essay, \u201cIris Finegan.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s parents split up when she was five, and her father subsequently had a limited place in her life. Donald Harris, a leftist critic of orthodox theories of underdevelopment, became the first Black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford\u2019s economics department. He wrote of Kamala and her sister, Maya, that \u201cmy one big regret is that they did not come to know very well the two most influential women in my life,\u201d Miss Iris and his other grandmother, Miss Chrishy. Donald reproduced with his essay a photograph of Miss Iris with a two-year-old Kamala on her knee. He recalled how\n\nwe drove up to Thatch Walk and worked our way, with lots of cuts and bruises, through the same cane fields where Miss Iris had run a thriving business in the \u201cgood ole days\u201d of sugar and, a long time before, had probably been part of a slave plantation.\n\nThis locates a potential American president in the fields where some of her ancestors were enslaved to the brutal task of cutting cane.\n\nIn this other history, a name like Finegan loses the meaning it has for Biden: a sense of continuity, an uncomplicated connection to a genetic heritage. These Irish ancestors cannot be assumed to be what they are to Biden\u2014heroic underdogs. Miss Chrishy was born Christiana Brown, and Donald Harris believes her to be a \u201cdescendant of Hamilton Brown.\u201d Hamilton Brown, who owned a large number of slaves in Jamaica and fiercely opposed abolition, was also Irish, born in County Antrim. But unlike John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Biden, and even Barack Obama, all of whom engaged in the public ritual of visiting Ireland to celebrate their ancestral roots, Harris would probably not want to celebrate her distant Finegan and Brown cousins.\n\nThis is because Blackness is seldom a free choice. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists at the end of July, Trump claimed that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d and had previously been identifying only with her Indian heritage. \u201cIs she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one but she obviously doesn\u2019t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she became a Black person.\u201d This was a lie\u2014Harris has always identified as Black. But it also revealed a certain kind of truth about one of the ways racism operates: Trump\u2019s attack on Harris was based on the assumption that she must be either Black or not Black.\n\nIt is easy for white Americans to pick an ethnicity\u2014Biden could have decided to identify with his French or English, rather than his Irish, heritage. It is easy for white Americans to tell little lies about their ancestry. Trump himself has more than once falsely claimed that his father, Fred, who was born in New York, was in fact born in Germany: \u201cMy father is German, was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany, so I have a very great feeling for Germany.\u201d Fred Trump himself claimed for some years that he was Swedish. Harris, on the other hand, could not cherry-pick from among her complex origins. Her mother was indeed born in India and lived there until she was nineteen. Yet Gopalan understood that her girls were not going to be perceived in America as Brahmins. As Harris puts it in The Truths We Hold:\n\nMy mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.\n\nThis is not a relishing of the openness of identity in America. It is something much more serious: an attempt to find the freedom within inevitability. Gopalan understood that her daughters could not escape the identity that a racist society would impose on them, including the history of enslavement that is part of their ancestry. What they could do is find the pride within that identity and embody the resistance that is the other side of that history.\n\nThey had to do this in an atmosphere of ferocious political engagement, in which these same questions of freedom and necessity were being hammered out within Black radicalism. Trump seeks to define Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d and there is no doubt that Republicans will delve into her parents\u2019 political stances in the 1960s to find evidence for this characterization. But it is the exact opposite of the truth. The radical left is a huge influence on Harris\u2014in the sense that she is part of a generational reaction against the revolutionary Black politics of the 1960s. She is a child of the revolution only in the sense that she grew up in its wreckage.\n\nThere is a figure in The Truths We Hold who is both named and not named, both intimately embraced and held at a distance. He is introduced as follows: Harris writes that San Francisco State University \u201chad a student-run Experimental College, and in 1966, another of my mother\u2019s dear friends, whom I knew as Uncle Aubrey, taught the college\u2019s first-ever class in black studies.\u201d We later learn that Aubrey\u2019s aunt, Regina Shelton, was a \u201csecond mother\u201d to Kamala and that \u201cwe shared a long-standing relationship of love, care, and connection\u201d to this extended family. Uncle Aubrey is not given his full name, Aubrey LaBrie. Nor does Harris say much about his politics.\n\nIn 2019 Harris told Molly Ball of Time that she remembered coming \u201cdown the stairs of her childhood house in Berkeley to see FREE BOBBY carved in wet cement, after the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was arrested.\u201d Her childhood world was that from which the Panthers emerged. In 1965 LaBrie, along with his brothers Huey and Abdul and other friends, founded a periodical called Black Dialogue. It was in part a cultural magazine, publishing stories, poems, and essays alongside graphic art by young Black painters. But it was also highly political, and Aubrey is listed as its \u201cpolitical editor,\u201d presumably responsible for its ideological direction. Its first issue appeared in the aftermath of the murder of Malcolm X and is \u201cproudly dedicated\u201d to his memory as a \u201cgreat leader and a greater MAN .\u201d\n\nIt was also produced immediately after the brutal police assault on peaceful civil rights marchers at Selma. It seethes with both the passion and the anguish of uncertainty that so many young Black activists felt in the face of such loss and violence. It despairs of the possibilities of looking to the two spheres that Kamala Harris would go on to inhabit\u2014the law and democratic politics\u2014to win justice:\n\nThe Black Americans are nauseated by the practices of the White community that are, to them, mockingly meaningless, hypocritical, dishonest and essentially amoral. These young Black people have no faith in the Constitution and no respect for the White man\u2019s law. Why should they? What has it done for them? The law is dispensed in a manner which makes it a great big atrocious lie. It is merely another weapon to use against them.\n\nAfter the Watts riots in Los Angeles in August 1965, when South Central LA became a combat zone and thirty-four people died, Black Dialogue published a call to arms by Aubrey LaBrie\u2019s younger brother Huey:\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters of Watts, how proud we are of you. You who burned the city of angels and shook the crumbling white power structure\u2026. The enemy called it a riot but we know that it was an insurrection. It was one battle in the \u201cwar of Armageddon\u201d or the war between the black and white. The blacks who participated in the insurrection introduced an extremely effective tactic of igniting fires to local parasitical white business communities. They were not rioters or hoodlums, they were guerrillas.\n\nThere is an irony here. The \u201cwar of Armageddon,\u201d as invoked in Black Dialogue, was almost certainly drawn from the preaching of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. But it now has no purchase on the American left or on mainstream Black politics. Where it does have a strong grip is on the dark imagination of Trumpism. The insurrectionist violence that Trump unleashed with the invasion of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was fed by the millenarian vision of a coming civil war, framed by many of its believers as a racial \u201cwar between the black and white.\u201d The Republican Party has moved into the orbit of apocalyptic tribalism. If you want to see a figure who represents the most definitive movement out of that orbit, look at Harris.\n\nHarris told Ball in 2019 that \u201cthe reality is that when you are the so-called minority you learn many languages, necessarily.\u201d She did not mean literal languages but rather the languages of power. Harris entered the very arenas her mother\u2019s friends and political allies had despaired of: the law, party politics, elective public office. She chose to believe what the previous generation could not\u2014that justice can be achieved by working from inside the existing institutional structures. It is an act of faith that critics of her work as a prosecutor and attorney general in California do not believe to be justified in practice by the way she used her power. She sought to uphold some wrongful convictions, threatened to prosecute parents of habitually truant children (a policy that disproportionately affected people of color), and even appealed a federal court ruling that California\u2019s death penalty is unconstitutional (in spite of her own complete repudiation of the death penalty). But her caution is not mere moderation or bland centrism. It comes from a complex personal and political navigation between the desire for freedom on the one side and the tight constraints of reality on the other.\n\nThat weighing of what is right against what is possible is the business of democracy, and Harris represents the way the left has accepted that difficult responsibility. American politics has ended up in a place where it is those on the right who want to burn everything down. They will do that, if they can, in the name of a phony American normality that excludes Harris and everyone who shares with her a complex identity. It is striking, therefore, that Harris\u2019s candidacy has given Democrats permission to point out how \u201cweird\u201d the Republicans\u2019 version of America really is. Walz put the word into circulation just days after Biden announced his departure from the national stage. In a punchy statement after Trump appeared on Fox News, the Harris campaign listed as one of the main takeaways: \u201cTrump is old and quite weird?\u201d The conjunction of these two qualities implies that what is truly strange is not just Trump\u2019s chronological age but the anachronistic vision in which only white men who plant their seed in fertile women are authentic citizens and legitimate rulers. Against that weirdness, we have the real possibility of a president whose history is synchronized with American reality.\n\n\u2014August 20, 2024"

            "text": "Yves here. At least some of whom are in the left are not accepting the premise that they must ignore the Democratic Party\u2019s sorry record and back Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd keep this point of view in mind:\n\nBy Robert Urie, author of Zen Economics, artist, and musician who publishes The Journal of Belligerent Pontification on Substack\n\n\u201cIf we lose, we\u2019ll be tried as war criminals.\u201d US General Curtis Lemay speaking of the US firebombing of Tokyo (and here) in WWII.\n\nIn addition to the war against Russia that the US launched with its coup in Ukraine of 2014, the next president of the US will have the US role in the genocide in Palestine to contend with. With respect to US relations abroad, it would be one thing if these conflicts had been forced on the US. But they weren\u2019t. They were chosen by the Biden-Harris administration as part of its too-little, too-late, recognition that US-based capital, Wall Street acting in league with subsidized industries like Big Tech, has destroyed the US economy for most workers, meaning citizens.\n\nOver the years, the position of Joe Biden with respect to China has been paradoxical. Or less charitably, incoherent. Biden joined with the (Bill) Clinton administration in 2000 to \u2018normalize\u2019 US trade relations with China so as to facilitate its entry into the WTO (World Trade Organization) in 2001. This followed Biden\u2019s support for NAFTA (1994), which established the institutional circumstances by which the American manufacturing base was handed over to China. It was decided that American workers would either be bond traders or fentanyl addicts. What they wouldn\u2019t be is industrial workers. Too many unions.\n\nGraphic: NATO was formed as a residual of American power in Europe following WWII. For the uninitiated, the US lost 400,000 people in WWII while the Russians, then Soviets, lost 27,000,000. In the present, as cover for, or denial of, US imperialism abroad, NATO has successfully changed the subject from domestic economic looting to \u2018Great Power politics.\u2019 Post-War ideological competition washed the ethos of Western imperialism, euphemisms and all, through the cleansing agent of theories that need never come into contact with their facts. Sources: US Embassy, Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Dr. Strangelove.\n\nThe outcome of five decades of neoliberal (capitalist) predation looks remarkably like Marxist analyses of the first half of the twentieth century had it. The GFC (global financial crisis) and the Great Recession that followed it led to a full recovery of the predatory economy, the one where raw political and economic power are used not simply to loot, but through lawfare, surveillance, and factionalized labor markets. to pin Americans under the repressive boot of unfettered capital. This is the world that the Biden-Harris administration was appointed to perpetuate.\n\nThe political analog, possibly easier to see because it is fresh in the minds of Americans, is the gathering of oligarch donors to select Kamala Harris to be the Democrats\u2019 candidate for president. The fake emergency regarding Joe Biden\u2019s age\u2014 the man was widely understood to be unable to distinguish fact from fantasy (and here) forty years ago, was used to render visible the class dynamic that has a tiny cabal of corporate welfare queens and trust-fund opportunists openly and explicitly determining Federal policy.\n\nMaps: the Russian complaint that NATO surrounded its western border after the US, Germany, and France individually and jointly promised not to, is an abstraction to Americans. In fact, the US has an answer to the question of what would happen if the Russians took actions similar to the US. It was called the Cuban Missile Crisis. Impressively, the story that Americans have been told about it is total bullshit. Not only had the Americans secretly placed nuclear weapons aimed at Moscow in Italy before the Russians sent weapons to Cuba, but word had it (link above) that JFK only had a fraction of the information that he needed regarding the US actions that precipitated the crisis. Source: cnbc.com.\n\nWhile the capitalist press loves to tout the self-made nature of \u2018wealth\u2019 in the US, the richest of the Forbes 400 all saw their fortunes multiplied by the Federal Reserve\u2019s relentless drive to raise the prices of financial assets since 2008. For example. Microsoft has a business that produces computer hardware and software. But it also has shares in the company that trade in financial markets. To the extent that Microsoft\u2019s shares trade above the value of Microsoft as a going concern, wealth \u2018creation\u2019 is illusory. What is achieved in financial markets is redistribution upwards, not wealth creation.\n\nThis was / is part of the problem created by the Wall Street bailouts of 2008. Shares are owned by the rich. If memory serves, 90% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of the population. Of this 10%, the very rich own a large preponderance of these shares. The American myth that people get rich by creating social (economic) value misses that in a financialized economy, the Federal Reserve plays a major role in economic distribution. Since 2008, the Fed has labored nonstop to make the very rich much, much, richer.\n\nGraph: Democrats have a choice of crediting the phenomenal rise in the wealth of the very rich during the Biden-Harris administration to either the business acumen of the billionaire class or to the actions of the Federal Reserve. The graph clearly illustrates an \u2018exogenous\u2019 driver of the rise in wealth\u2014 the Federal Reserve. Otherwise, the results would be mixed. Capitalist economists credit the entire rise in the wealth of the rich to business acumen. Here is the Forbes 400 list. Please read Forbes\u2019 explanation of this argument to understand why this is a problem for the rest of us. Source: inequality.org.\n\nThis all ties back to the subject at hand, electoral politics in the US, through the role that wealthy donors just played in the elevation of Kamala Harris to be the Democrats\u2019 candidate for president. Again, if great wealth indicated a greater social contribution, that would have one meaning. But what it indicates in this case is that an agency of the Federal government made it its mission to make already rich people much, much, richer. This is part of the argument for why Barack Obama was a disaster as president. He rebuilt this rigged system whereby all social wealth is institutionally organized to flow upwards. And that is why oligarchs are supporting the Democrats.\n\nIt is US foreign policy that ties this post-bailout economic dysfunction to the empire-in-decline-that-is-acting-out-abroad that the US now represents. Readers are welcomed to agree or disagree with the characterizations of US foreign policy presented here. But what you can\u2019t disagree with are the facts. A team of professional liars, prevaricators, and bullshit artists were apparently assigned to countering the fact that the Russians were repeatedly told by US and European officials that NATO would be kept away from Russia\u2019s border. As the second graph up illustrates, between 1990 and 2023, NATO has surrounded Russia\u2019s western border with the exceptions of Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nIrrespective of whether or not you agree with the Russian position on the matter, the Russians have a legitimate grievance under any reasonable reading of this history. But what was it that elevated a thirty-year-old (dis)agreement to geopolitical relevance in 2022? That would be the 2014 US-led coup in Ukraine (link above) in which the US assumed control of the Ukrainian political system. Here is the infamous phone call in which Americans Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt selected the post-coup Ukrainian government. The people that Nuland said that she would put in office were put in office.\n\nFollowing the US-led coup in Ukraine and the selection of the post-coup government by American neocons, the CIA built permanent facilities on the Ukrainian border with Russia with which to surveil and attack the Russians. Further, as (Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs) Victoria Nuland put it in 2022, eight years after the US-led coup in Ukraine took place, Ukraine was (is) loaded to the gills with bioweapons labs. Whatever their genesis (Soviet, US), the US had controlled Ukraine for nearly a decade before Nuland admitted their existence.\n\nGraphic: it is telling to see how openly and crudely racist Israelis are toward Palestinians in their social media posts. While seeing the Israelis channeling their inner Nazis has a depressing, Freudian, quality to it, seeing Americans like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump doing everything in their power to perpetuate a racist genocide is even sadder, if not quite as Freudian. Presumably, Biden \u2013 Harris wouldn\u2019t be engaged in such an act unless they thought it to be in the strategic interest of the US. But if this were the case, why is every word they say about it be a lie? Sources: al Jazeera English, Wikipedia.\n\nWith respect to the US \u2013 Israeli genocide currently underway in Palestine, Kamala Harris recently repeated the materially false Biden administration \u2013 Israeli state narrative around the Hamas attack inside Israel on October 7, 2023. As a recent analysis by Haaretz revealed, a material proportion\u2014 up to half, of the Israelis killed on October 7 were killed by the IDF (Israel Defense Force) under the Hannibal Directive issued by the Israeli political leadership. Further, the claims that Hamas used sexual violence\u2014 the \u2018mass rape\u2019 narrative, has been debunked by reporters at The Grayzone (see here, here, here).\n\nThe social dynamic that this factionalized \u2018truth\u2019 creates is of political cults that believe every word handed them by people they trust, as they discount every word uttered by those in competing political cults. Instead of wielding political power, the members of these cults exist to trade group-affirming talking points on social media, exhibiting little awareness that the leaders of both cults work for the same corporate chieftains and oligarchs. Or if not the exact same corporate chieftains and oligarchs, those who hold similar political \u2013 economic roles in different cults.\n\nThat Kamala Harris knew, or should have known, that what she was telling her constituents about the US conflicts in Palestine and Ukraine is untrue has political importance. Because she is an allegedly functioning adult who is vying for an official position of power in a major nation, she should know the facts of these conflicts. That there was no distance between her recitation of fake facts and that of the Pentecostal wing of the Republican party illustrates the conundrum. A necessary first step to solving problems is to understand their causes.\n\nThe model on which the US and Israeli responses to October 7 appear to be based is 9/11. Readers will recall that the George W. Bush administration was never made to give sworn testimony to the 9/11 commission regarding its knowledge of events, and 2) was allowed to redact the pages of the Report issued by the commission that implicated the Saudis in the attacks. Both decisions were superficially defensible. There is a separation of powers issue with compelling sworn testimony from a sitting president. And the Saudis were (in theory) US allies, in addition to being business partners with the Bush family.\n\nLittle need be said with respect to the fact that fewer than half of Americans believe the official explanation of 9/11, or that about half of Americans (link above) believe that the Federal government of the US was behind the attacks. While this may be interesting, it isn\u2019t the point. The Bush administration entered office in 2001 intent on launching a war against Iraq. In addition to redirecting attention away from the Saudis, Bush attributed knowingly false motives for the 9/11 attacks to the Iraqis. Here is (Saudi national) Osama bin Laden explaining why al Qaeda attacked the US on 9/11.\n\nAlong with Wall Street\u2019s implosion of the economy in 2008, public disillusion over the US war in Iraq represents a lynchpin in the imperial decline that the US is now decades into. George W. Bush lied the people who historically have fought American wars into going to Iraq based on false claims about why they were doing so. Bush\u2019s \u2018pre-emptive war\u2019 relied on a credible threat having been posed by Iraq that simply did not exist. Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11captures the psychological panic that the Bush administration successfully conjured to coerce Americans into fighting its war.\n\nBut actions have consequences. Having been lied into losing lives, limbs, and / or killing Iraqi civilians to put another dollar or two on Halliburton\u2019s stock price, much of the soldier class was subsequently foreclosed on and / or rendered unemployed by Wall Street. These are the people that American liberals and \u2018the Left\u2019 were calling \u2018fascists\u2019 2016 \u2013 present because they wouldn\u2019t vote for the people who lied them into the war in Iraq and then took their houses as their jobs were systematically disappeared in the Great Recession.\n\nEach of these acts undertaken against the interests of the American people features one or more groups or actors that purposely undertook them to enrich themselves and / or to accrue power. Neither the US war in Iraq, the GFC, nor the Great Recession, were facts of nature. They were each caused by the acts of some humans seeking to benefit from taking from other humans. In class terms, these were the actions of the rich preying on the rest of us. Each act had systemic drivers requiring institutional mediation. The rich have organized the US to vacuum up social wealth for their own benefit.\n\nThe ready-made genocide, genocide-in-a-box if you will, that the US and Israel have engaged in in Palestine since October 7, 2023 never looked like a response to the attack by Hamas. It has looked like an effort to exterminate the people of Gaza since it began. Supporting this interpretation have been Israeli Zionists who have said straightforwardly(and here, here, here, here) and repeatedly that \u2018clearing\u2019 Palestine of Palestinians is the goal. Here is Israeli Zionist Chanamel Dorfman, aide to Israeli Defense Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, complaining that the Nazis killed the wrong people. Is this really an argument worth making?\n\nGraphic: Some, possibly many, readers will be offended by conflation of Kamala Harris\u2019s likely policies with those of the Biden administration. After all, she\u2019s her own person, runs the logic. However, ensuring that Harris isn\u2019t her own person was the entire point of the oligarchs (donors) interviewing her before elevating her as their candidate. They wouldn\u2019t have elevated her if they hadn\u2019t liked what they heard in the interviews. More than anything else, it is this idea of personality-driven politics that unites American liberals with their fascist forebears. As long as hippie-earth-mother is willing to slaughter a million Palestinians for Israeli fascists, hire her! That doing so means that she never was hippie-earth-mother won\u2019t be understood until after the money has been deposited in the bank.\n\nSo, when Kamala Harris repeats largely or fully debunked charges of Palestinian crimes on October 7 as if they really happened while ignoring evidence that the Israelis are knowingly and intentionally acting to exterminate the Palestinian people in Palestine, possible explanations include that she is misinformed, knowingly lying, or that she is incapable of separating truth from fiction. Alternatively, if the truth supports her position on the war, why is she lying? The reasonable inference to draw is that Harris knows that the truth doesn\u2019t support her position.\n\nChart: the great mystery of US foreign policy has finally been solved. Quickly, what is it that unites Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and Libya in the minds of US foreign policy officials? Well, the officials\u2014 most of whom are currently engaged in a racist genocide in Palestine, would say that these nations are all \u2018authoritarian.\u2019 With billionaire donors and the CIA currently \u2018overseeing\u2019 American elections, the contrast that gave the fear of fascism its punch is looking more like a merging of interests. Source: worldometers.info.\n\nReaders will recall that the George W. Bush administration wove the alleged facts of 9/11 into its policy decision to launch a war against Iraq. The purpose was to frame the war as defensive when it was an offensive war. It wasn\u2019t until no weapons of mass destruction had been found and the war was coming unwound (2005) that a single true fact regarding 9/11 or the war could be uttered in the US. Further, with \u2018loyalty oaths\u2019 (to their administration) required for citizens to gain admittance to public rallies featuring government officials, the Bush administration understood the fascist roots of its political program.\n\nWhat Harris\u2019s statement (link above) regarding events in Palestine and Ukraine indicates is that she has fully internalized the lies emanating from US and Israeli officials regarding US foreign policy, and that she will act as if they are true if she is elected president. As with the KKK using emotive terms like \u2018international Jewry\u2019 to signify group allegiance, the Democrats have a fully developed internal discourse around US foreign policy that is unquestioned and unquestionable. It was hardly ironic then that Joe Biden was George W. Bush\u2019s point man in selling the false story of Iraq\u2019s WMDs to Democrats.\n\nWith all that is, and isn\u2019t, being said by leading Democrats about the wars in Ukraine and Palestine, it is the facts on the ground that future US political leaders will be forced to reckon with. Russia\u2019s western border is zero miles from Ukraine, whereas Washington DC is 5,000 miles from Kiev. US weapons and materiel are fussy and ludicrously expensive. Russian weapons and materiel are robust and designed to maximize lethality, versus the US goal of maximizing profits for the MIC. In other words, it was capitalism that rendered the American MIC considerably worse than useless.\n\nUS participation in the genocide in Palestine recalls the arguments of philosophers and scholars following WWII that what it was that differentiated the Holocaust from ordinary history was the effort by the Nazis to exterminate a people\u2014 the Jews. However, reading the quote from US General Curtis LeMay above regarding the firebombing of Tokyo, which he led, doesn\u2019t impart a sense of a self-evident moral difference between Allied actions in WWII and those of the Axis Powers. Lemay didn\u2019t see one, at any rate.\n\nWithin the frame of \u2018military valor\u2019 (that is not endorsed here), LeMay was an actual hero in WWII. The firebombing of Tokyo that he led burned 100,000 Japanese civilians alive on its first night. All told, the firebombing of civilian populations in Japan ended up killing between 330,000 and 900,000 people. Additionally, the allies bombed civilian populations in Germany relentlessly, with the bombing of Dresden being one of the better-known cases.\n\nFrom the perspective of the present, civilian deaths from American wars are plausibly viewed as \u2018collateral damage.\u2019 But they aren\u2019t collateral\u2014 meaning unintended even if predictable, because the civilians were intentionally targeted. Here, Osama bin Laden explains why he believed that American civilians were legitimate targets in the 9/11 attacks. For Americans who imagine that the illusion of democracy, fake democracy if you will, protects them from political reprisals for US actions taken abroad, the bin Laden letter is essential reading.\n\nDuring the Cold War, General LeMay advocated pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the USSR (now Russia) and China (link above) while the US still had a strategic advantage by way of its larger nuclear arsenal. This didn\u2019t mean \u2018strategically\u2019 or \u2018surgically\u2019 striking Command Centers\u2014 it meant slaughtering half-a-billion civilians\u2014while they were wholly or partially defenseless. How then were Americans in 1965 morally horrified by the Holocaust when in ordinary conversations they advocated forcefully for the murder of half-a-billion innocents?\n\nThe lesson that the so-called intelligence agencies learned through the psychological manipulation of the American public during the Cold War was that once the groundwork\u2014 the instilling of unreasoned fears, had been laid, Americans would agree to pretty much anything. Even after no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq and the war had turned into the predictable catastrophe that it was, most Americans still found inane drivel about \u2018freedom\u2019 attached to the war to be compelling. To money-shot from the epoch: \u2018freedom ain\u2019t free.\u2019\n\nAn aspect shared between Zionism and Nazism is the conceptual shift from the general claim of peoples with rights as such to the claim that particular peoples are special, and therefore deserve special rights. Following WWII, the argument was put forward that it was the Nazi effort to exterminate an entire people\u2014 the Jews, that separated the Holocaust from ordinary history. The Zionist shift from the defense of the rights of \u2018peoples\u2019 to the special rights of Jews recreated a variation on the racial case claimed by the Nazis.\n\nThe Nazis held retrograde racial views (borrowed from American eugenicists) that they claimed distinguished them from the rest of humanity. The Zionist claim is that Jews are God\u2019s chosen people, and that this distinguishes them from the rest of humanity. The Nazi\u2019s \u2018Thousand-year Reich\u2019 lasted about fifteen years. This is evidence against the claim that the Nazis possessed superior racial qualities. Likewise, if the Jews are God\u2019s chosen people, why not leave the public assertions of this fact to their God? In fact, like American Pentecostals, they don\u2019t trust their own God to follow scripture as they have interpreted it.\n\nThe practical problem with both theories is that there are about eight billion humans on the planet, most of whom are on the wrong side of Nazi / Zionist supremacy. That Democrats can\u2019t see American racial history in the Zionist\u2019s treatment of Palestinians might be bizarre if it weren\u2019t so politically convenient. In 2024, American Democrats, led by the senior leadership of their party, are consciously and knowingly supporting a genocide against a racial, religious, and ethnic minority in Palestine. This makes them racists engaged in a racist genocide.\n\nThe social destruction being caused by both American conflicts ties to this latter point. WWI begat WWII. Further, it was the Biden administration\u2019s decision to place these conflicts within the broader frame of economic competition between nations. Anyone who has followed the environmental back-and-forth of recent years knows that renewed imperial competition has been underway for decades now. A race is on by the US to secure the resources needed to fulfill the Democrats\u2019 EV fantasies. As usual, the effort is bounded by too-convenient assertions that they can\u2019t cross \u2018their\u2019 donors because Trump!\n\nGraph: the Biden administration\u2019s claim that it engineered a major recovery in manufacturing employment in the US isn\u2019t a reason to uncork the champagne just yet. The facts are that \u2018the Biden miracle\u2019 was a reflexive recovery following the catastrophe of the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden\u2019s real contribution to manufacturing employment came through his support for NAFTA. Additionally, Biden supported the normalization of trade relations with China that facilitated China\u2019s admission to the WTO in 2001. Together, these caused the precipitous decline from 19.5 million manufacturing workers in 1980 to 13 million today. Source: Federal Reserve of St. Louis.\n\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald has done a respectable job of identifying and commenting on the delusion, ignorance, and hypocrisy of the young Democrats now rushing to support Harris. As was the case with young Democrats in 2020, the response is Pavlovian. Good dog. What a good dog. Now, rollover and play dead. While the officials of various Federal agencies must be beaming with pride at their ability to manipulate electoral politics with such finesse, they have created the political equivalent of highly processed foods.\n\nAs the current American political leadership effectively demonstrates, capitalists favor having compliant, not-bright, people holding public office to do their bidding. This isn\u2019t to suggest that a cabal of evil geniuses is running things. Having met and had long conversations with many very rich people, the only class dumber than the US political class are the oligarchs. What part of the nuclear annihilation that Biden-Harris are working so hard to bring about in Ukraine don\u2019t Harris\u2019s oligarch benefactors understand?\n\nTying this back to economics for a moment, the Democrat\u2019s focus on child \u2018influencers\u2019 in Chicago was more than just political marketing. Following from 1990s Republican neoliberal Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract with America, influencers, Uber drivers, cashiers, fentanyl dealers, financial advisors, crypto speculators, disinformation specialists, personal shoppers, bud-tenders, and dog-walkers represent the culmination of the Democrats\u2019 industrial policy. So no, your \u2018career\u2019 picking up dog crap in the street (\u2018piece work\u2019) isn\u2019t how your grandparents raised a family.\n\nThe lever for Greenwald\u2019s critique (above) is incongruity\u2014 the fact that reconciliation by the young with the party of Genocide Joe appears to have been so quick and easy. The \u2018Hitler Youth\u2019 quality of the conversion was / is impressive. However, what is the alternative? Toll-booth Zionist Trump! has already committed to the pay-as-you-go slaughter of Palestinians funded by Miriam Adelson. The only antiwar candidate in the upcoming is Jill Stein, whom the Democrats have successfully marginalized. But if you\u2019re going to vote, Stein is the best (only) hope for the US.\n\nIn fact, the purpose of the American one-party system, the uniparty, is to ensure that nothing changes. Or rather, the faces change, but the policies stay the same. The hope held by Democrats that Harris\u2019s policies will be less genocidal than Biden\u2019s misses that the only people who interviewed her before she was elevated to be their candidate for president were donors. In fact, the donors are the glue that holds the uniparty together. How else could, marketing chatter aside, Biden and Trump have nearly identical policies?\n\nFinally, not a word of this essay is anti-American. Opposing US foreign policy\u2014 the product of an antique and decrepit MIC filtered through the corrupt and dysfunctional American system of political graft, is to argue that the policies of officialdom run counter to the larger interests of the US and the world. Anti-Americanism is precisely what the George W. Bush administration engaged in when it lied the US into war with Iraq.\n\nFurther, the Germans are still apologizing for the Nazis seven decades after they were defeated in WWII. The Biden administration\u2019s choice to emulate the Nazis by engaging in racist genocide likewise will have one meaning in the short term, and quite another in the longer term. As I wrote in multiple essays before the 2020 election, Joe Biden, like George W. Bush before him, is the embodiment of imperial decline. Kamala Harris represents an effort to put a fresh face on the same old imperialist foreign policy. You can understand this now or three years from now. The choice is yours."

            "text": "Official Trailer for 'Paris Has Fallen' Action Series with Tewfik Jallab\n\n\"When the city falls, heroes will rise.\" Studiocanal has launched an official trailer for their upcoming action series called Paris Has Fallen, streaming in France first this fall. This is a TV continuation of the \"Has Fallen\" franchise of movies - which includes Olympus Has Fallen (2013), London Has Fallen (2016), Angel Has Fallen (2019). While we wait for the next Night Has Fallen movie, it's time to head to Paris for another dangerous mission. A protection officer and an MI6 operative team up after a terrorist attack in Paris. They suspect a mole as they race to thwart a larger conspiracy threatening Paris. The plot follows protection officer Vincent Taleb who finds himself working with street-smart MI6 agnet Zara Taylor to save the day. Starring Tewfik Jallab, Ritu Arya, and Sean Harris as the main bad guy, with Ana Ularu, Camille Rutherford, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Covillault, Emmanuelle Bercot, Karl Collins, and Nathan Willcocks, and others. No idea why they needed to make a series from this action franchise, but why not I guess? Wasn't Sean Harris already a villain in a Mission Impossible film? Alas this doesn't look as good as any of the films.\n\nHere's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Studiocanal's series Paris Has Fallen, direct from YouTube:\n\nWhen a terrorist group led by Jacob Pearce (Sean Harris) attacks a high-profile event, with the French Minister of Defence as their target, protection officer Vincent Taleb (Tewfik Jallab) finds himself working with street-smart MI6 operative Zara Taylor (Ritu Arya) to save the day. But when events take a dark turn, Vincent and Zara soon realize that the plan extends beyond just one politician. When they suspect that one of their colleagues in the security services is feeding information to Jacob, Vincent and Zara find themselves needing to rely only on each other. Increasingly isolated and with Jacob always one step ahead, can this unlikely pair stop Paris from falling to a man hell-bent on vengeance? Paris Has Fallen is a new series created and written by Howard Overman, a writer on the series \"Vexed\", \"Merlin\", \"Misfits\", \"Atlantis\", \"Crazyhead\", \"Future Man\", \"The One\", \"War of the Worlds\" previously. With episodes directed by Hans Herbots and Oded Ruskin. Produced by Johnny Capps, Julian Murphy, Howard Overman. Exec produced by Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Greenstein, Avi Lerner, Yariv Lerner, Jonathan Yunger, Oded Ruskin, Alan Siegel. Studiocanal will debut Paris Has Fallen on Canal+ in France starting September 23rd, 2024."

Beide Kandidaten, Donald Trump und Kamala Harris, k\u00e4mpfen um die entscheidenden Stimmen. Doch welche Taktiken setzen sie ein, um ihre Gegner zu schlagen, und welche Themen k\u00f6nnten den Ausschlag geben? Darum geht es in dieser Folge von \u201eThis is America\u201c.\n\nNach dem Ende der Parteitage beginnt nun die entscheidende Phase, in der beide Kandidaten alles daransetzen, ihre W\u00e4hlerbasis zu mobilisieren und unentschlossene W\u00e4hler in den wichtigen Swing States zu \u00fcberzeugen.\n\nDer Wahlkampf wird von beiden Seiten zunehmend aggressiv gef\u00fchrt. Besonders interessant ist, wie beide Seiten ihre Strategien anpassen, um die Schwachstellen des Gegners auszunutzen.\n\nTrump greift Harris pers\u00f6nlich an\n\nTrump setzt \u2013 auch gegen den Willen seiner Partei \u2013 bislang vor allem auf pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe auf Kamala Harris. Im Podcast diskutieren US-Korrespondentin Stefanie Bolzen und WELT-Redakteurin Antonia Beckermann dar\u00fcber, warum Trump nach wie vor Schwierigkeiten zu haben scheint, Harris effektiv anzugreifen, ohne dabei als rassistisch oder frauenfeindlich wahrgenommen zu werden.

            "headline": "Laughing at Trump",
            "text": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nDemocrats are lately employing a strategy against Donald Trump that he has been using effectively against his opponents for years: mockery. It started with the vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz calling Trump \u201cweird\u201d and then bloomed into a bouquet of insults at the Democratic convention: unserious, self-involved, entitled, obsessed with crowd sizes, \u201cfell asleep at his own trial.\u201d Where did this strategy come from? Will it remain effective? And can it backfire?\n\nIn this episode, we talk with the Atlantic staff writer David Graham, who was at the Democratic convention and also covers Trump. And we talk with a surprising muse for the politics of mockery: Conservative lawyer and activist George Conway has been using targeted mockery against Trump for years, with unusual success. He reflects on what it means for Democrats to adopt this strategy.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nBarack Obama: There\u2019s the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. [Crowd laughter]\n\nHanna Rosin: The sight last week at the Democratic National Convention of Barack Obama, the dignified statesman and 44th president of the United States, up on stage, looking down at his two hands as he made a joke about Trump\u2019s, ahem, size.\n\nObama: It just goes on and on and on. [Applause]\n\nRosin: That was a revelation to me. In 2016, as Donald Trump was doling out belittling nicknames and insults, Michelle Obama famously told her fellow Democrats, When they go low, we go high.\n\nAnd then in the last month, it\u2019s like a whisper campaign went out among Democrats: Climb on down. Just say it. Say on a national stage that thing that you\u2019ve been saying to your friends, Michelle.\n\nMichelle Obama: Who\u2019s gonna tell him that the job he\u2019s currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?\n\nRosin: In fact, if you want to, you can even rhyme it, Bill.\n\nBill Clinton: He mostly talks about himself, so the next time you hear him, don\u2019t count the lies. Count the I\u2019s.\n\nRosin: It\u2019s not that politicians haven\u2019t insulted each other for centuries. They do, and they have. Some insults stick; some don\u2019t. It\u2019s part of the game. But with the exception of Trump, I\u2019ve never seen a political strategy of insults dominate an entire party and take off so thoroughly and quickly and gleefully. It\u2019s like ever since Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz said the word weird\u2014Trump is weird. J. D. Vance is weird. Their policies are weird\u2014a door opened up, and Democrats rushed right through it.\n\nNow, in other countries that deal with authoritarian leaders, mockery is a known strategy, a way of deflating a leader\u2019s too-big ego. It can be really effective, also possibly dangerous. And of course, it can backfire.\n\nHere in the U.S., though, it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t fully explored yet. So today is a two-part show. First, we\u2019ll talk to Atlantic staff writer David Graham, who was at the convention and covers Trump and so is the perfect person to help us dissect the politics of mockery, where they came from, how they might roll out in the next few months, and how they can go wrong.\n\nAnd then, it turns out there\u2019s a surprising muse for the new dump-on-Trump approach. He\u2019s a conservative who\u2019s written for The Atlantic: George Conway. He used to be married to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. And during his years of observing his ex-wife\u2019s boss, he gathered an arsenal of insights about how to make fun of Trump in a way that gets under his skin.\n\nAnd he tried them out before anyone else was doing it.\n\nGeorge Conway: The best way to hit the soft underbelly of his psychological disorders is to mock him. He cannot take mockery. It is the thing that makes him craziest, and the mockery diminishes him. It makes him look weak. And that\u2019s, you know, the reason why his followers follow him\u2014they think he is a strong man. And he is not.\n\nRosin: These days, Conway is looking prescient. But before we hear from him, I want to understand how Democrats are using this new strategy and what it might do for their chances in November.\n\nWith me to explain is staff writer David Graham. Hey, David.\n\nDavid Graham: Hello!\n\nRosin: Hi. So in 2016, as you know, Michelle Obama famously declared, \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d We all know that lately we\u2019re in a \u201cwe go low\u201d moment. And I have found it just fascinating to watch, just anthropologically, how this line coalesced and became so effective, in what seems to be, instantaneously.\n\nI\u2019m curious, as a political reporter, what you\u2019ve seen.\n\nGraham: I think, maybe, just going high kind of ran out of usefulness. I don\u2019t think it worked for a while. It didn\u2019t work in 2016 for Democrats. You know, they lost that election. But in 2020, you had Joe Biden going out with this kind of soul-of-America, Jon Meacham\u2013written speeches thing, which I think was a variation on that\u2014you know, very high-minded and lofty rhetoric and \u201cwe\u2019re going to save the soul of the nation\u201d stuff.\n\nAnd that worked. And then at some point, people got sick of it. It sort of lost its novelty. And, suddenly, you see Democrats ready to throw some punches, and that seems to be working for them now.\n\nRosin: Was it a spontaneous occurrence that just happened when the word weird came out of Tim Walz\u2019s mouth? Or do you get a sense it was more of an orchestrated campaign?\n\nGraham: I think there\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean, Walz clearly hit on something with weird. And it was interesting, even\u2014you could see him sort of developing it over a series of TV hits and recognizing that it was working and then being like, Oh, I\u2019m going to do that. Push that button more.\n\nBut I think even outside of that, kind of from the moment that Biden stepped down, you saw the nascent Harris campaign taking a little bit more aggressive approach and being less like, We\u2019re going to stand back. We\u2019re going to tell you about how important the stakes are, with a very deep voice, and more like, Yeah, let\u2019s bring it. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s mix this up.\n\nAnd so I think those things are all kind of connected and have coalesced to form a sort of go-low strategy, I guess.\n\nI mean, what blew me away\u2014and this sort of gets to the shift, I think\u2014is the back-to-back speeches by the Obamas at the DNC, because they have been so much the avatars of this. You know, it was Michelle Obama who used that phrase in the first place.\n\nYou know, they\u2019re very dignified. They try to sort of stay above the fray. And so Michelle comes in and gives one of the hotter political speeches I think I\u2019ve ever witnessed live and throws some punches in that one, talks about not expecting things to be given to us, sort of stuff.\n\nAnd then Barack Obama comes up after that and makes\u2014I\u2019m not even sure how I can refer to this\u2014makes an unsubtle joke about Trump\u2019s manhood.\n\nRosin: Yes. That was good. That was good. Good job there. \u201cManhood.\u201d I like it. Very 19th century. Yeah.\n\nGraham: And of all the people to say that\u2014Barack Obama. You know, he\u2019s a funny guy but, man, I almost couldn\u2019t believe it. So that\u2019s the one that sticks with me.\n\nRosin: You know what was astonishing to me about that moment? I did believe that, probably, when Michelle and Barack talk to each other, they talk like this, in the same way sort of people talk like this. It\u2019s not that you\u2019ve never heard Trump referenced or described in these ways.\n\nIt\u2019s just out loud in an official proceeding. It was the saying out loud of things that, you know, people normally just say to their friends. That\u2019s the breach that I was curious about. Like, how did everyone decide this is politically acceptable to say in public?\n\nGraham: Right. Right. Totally. Well, I think also there\u2019s\u2014Democrats, either intentionally or unintentionally, coupled the idea that democracy is important and there have to be guardrails and there have to be rules to the idea that also you can\u2019t say mean things.\n\nAnd I think what we\u2019re seeing from them now is you can actually decouple those things. You can talk about democracy being important. You can talk about guardrails. But it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t also ridicule Trump.\n\nRosin: Yes. And, in fact, I noticed that it was an order of operations\u2014that the mockery would come first, and then, But to be sure, we should take him seriously.\n\nGraham: Yeah. A Spoonful of Mockery Makes the Medicine Go Down, or whatever.\n\nRosin: Yeah, something like that. Now, I have been reading, I mean, at least back to 2020, maybe 2015\u2014there are often an op-ed or two, often from people who are either from other countries or have experience reporting in other countries that say, Mock the dictator. Like, Dictators are deflatable. In general, one thing I have learned from living slash reporting overseas is that dictators have big egos, and you just have to puncture them.\n\nAnd then they quote George Orwell, who\u2019ll say, \u201cEvery joke is a tiny revolution.\u201d And it does seem to be a strategy that\u2019s been out there and that nobody\u2019s plucked or used before.\n\nGraham: Yeah, I think part of that is it doesn\u2019t come naturally to the people who the Democrats have had atop their tickets.\n\nRosin: Mm-hmm.\n\nGraham: It\u2019s just not a Hillary Clinton thing, and it\u2019s not really a Joe Biden thing, either. And I think Harris just feels more naturally at home doing that.\n\nRosin: Do you have a theory about why weird worked? It\u2019s such a casual, nothing word.\n\nGraham: I mean, I think it\u2019s a couple things. One, J. D. Vance says some things that are pretty weird. I mean, I think it just resonates because it feels accurate, and it resonates because it was coming from Tim Walz, who feels so much like your high-school geography teacher. And so it feels like something he\u2014it doesn\u2019t feel calculated coming from him.\n\nIt feels really genuine and like he\u2019s the right messenger for that. Maybe that\u2019s it. I mean, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so simple. It seems like it ought to be\u2014it\u2019s hard for me to believe that just a single word this simple has permeated so quickly. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get over it quickly. But, like, even this much?\n\nRosin: But the way it permeated is fascinating because, in my mind, the word weird\u2014I do think of it like a series of literal dominoes. So you could have called J. D. Vance scary. Instead, they settled on weird, and weird is actually a way to reclaim the silent majority. Like, it is a flip.\n\nGraham: Mm-hmm.\n\nRosin: It\u2019s like: You\u2019re the weird ones. Like, We\u2019re the regular ones. We\u2019re the majority. And then the campaign kind of builds on top of that little word and reclaims freedom and then builds on top of that and reclaims patriotism. So this kind of dumb, nothing word becomes the cornerstone of an entire strategy of role reversals, you know?\n\nGraham: Yeah, and it\u2019s also tied to them\u2014you know, Harris sort of trying to run as an insurgent against an incumbent, even though she is the vice president, and he\u2019s not in office. All of these things tie together, totally.\n\nRosin: Right. There\u2019s just a flip. Okay, now I want to talk a little bit about the dangers of this strategy. You and I both work at The Atlantic magazine. I would argue that The Atlantic magazine has been very invested in taking Trump\u2019s threat to the future of our democracy very seriously. And so there is a way in which minimizing the threatening aspects of it makes it seem silly or like the person isn\u2019t really powerful, and it seems like there\u2019s some danger in that.\n\nGraham: Yes, I think that totally is right. But I do think there\u2019s a danger of minimization. And, like you were saying, you saw them sort of trying to do this, like, make the jokes and then kind of, But seriously, folks. This guy\u2019s going to tear down democracy. And it\u2019s tough to make those things go together. I also have questions about whether it really will be effective over an extended period of time. And I think about Republicans in the 2016 primary trying to ridicule Trump and use that against him, and mostly they all flopped.\n\nRosin: What do you mean? Can you give me an example?\n\nGraham: Oh, yeah. So Marco Rubio made another sort of suggestive, phallic remark talking about why Trump was so defensive about having small hands and got a response from Trump, but it didn\u2019t really work for Rubio. He ended up looking sort of like a middle-school kid trying to make a rude joke, and obviously he did not win the nomination.\n\nRosin: I think it\u2019s the many against the one. I\u2019ve thought about that too, because obviously this is not the first time anyone\u2019s, you know, used their hands and made the Obama joke. But it has to be everybody.\n\nIt\u2019s like that moment in the high-school movie when, at first, it\u2019s one kid against the other kid, and the bully always wins. But then, suddenly, the entire school comes up with the line, and then the entire school all of a sudden represents joy and goodness, and they\u2019re the ones singing on top of the desks, and the former bully is hiding under the desk. Like, it can\u2019t be one-on-one. And that\u2019s what\u2019s the sort of amazement of this moment, is how it coalesced and took form all at once.\n\nGraham: Well, I think Trump has lost something, too. He seems to have lost some of his speed. So you know, I think Axios had a story a week or two ago about his failure to come up with a nickname for Harris and listed all of the things that he\u2019s tried, and just none of them are taking. And it\u2019s hard for me to remember the last time he came up with a really good nickname, or at least a really catchy nickname.\n\nAnd so I think, maybe, Democrats sense some weakness and sense that he can be attacked in a way that he just can\u2019t defend as well as he once could. I also wonder if maybe he\u2019s just\u2014we\u2019re used to him. He\u2019s not as novel, and that takes some of the power out of him.\n\nRosin: Yeah, some of it is novelty. I mean, that\u2019s cheesily poetic, like an O. Henry story that the metaphor is his inability to come up\u2014like, the last one was \u201ccommunist Kamala.\u201d Like, his inability to come up with a nickname that sticks, that\u2019s the moment when he crumbles. So interesting.\n\nOkay. Back, though, to regular strategy. So here\u2019s another danger, just strategically, if you\u2019re running Kamala\u2019s campaign. If you\u2019re making fun of Trump, there\u2019s an implied audience to your message. Like, you are signaling, I am speaking to people who make fun of Trump. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the people that she needs to be speaking to right now. Those people are already with her.\n\nGraham: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think that if it works\u2014the kind of ridiculing strategy works because it actually reaches other people. I mean, the high-minded approach, I think, has reached all the people it can. If you think that democracy is under threat from Trump, you\u2019re probably already supporting Harris.\n\nSo that\u2019s kind of a base play at this point, in a weird way. But, you know, if you\u2019re not sure\u2014maybe you\u2019re one of these voters who voted for Trump once or twice but maybe not with a lot of enthusiasm, and then you were kind of appalled by January 6, but you also haven\u2019t loved the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nIf you make this guy seem small and weak and ridiculous, I think it can appeal to some of those people, in the same way that the schoolyard bully, by being undercut, suddenly loses his power over everyone. Like, once someone recognizes that he can be punctured, there\u2019s no one who can be bullied, because they\u2019ve seen that he just doesn\u2019t have the mojo anymore.\n\nRosin: So you\u2019re a political reporter who\u2019s been covering Trump for a very long time. What do you imagine he\u2019s saying and doing now? We\u2019ve had dribs and drabs from the campaign, but I wonder, where do you think he\u2019s at now?\n\nBecause we\u2019ve been talking about the strategy aimed at him. But I\u2019m curious\u2014and I know this is speculation\u2014how is it landing on him?\n\nGraham: Right. You know, he tends to rage whenever he\u2019s down. He gets really upset. And I think even in his public pronouncements, we can see a little bit of this. Like, threatening to pull out of the debate is a gesture of frustration with the way things are going, frustration with the coverage. And, you know, those things come and go, but I think the fact that those rumors are circulating is a sign of the kind of backbiting inside Trump headquarters that we remember well from previous campaigns but hadn\u2019t seen until now.\n\nRosin: This private raging and campaign chaos, it\u2019s not just a side effect of this kind of messaging. It\u2019s a strategy unto itself. And it\u2019s one that my next guest has spent years thinking about. George Conway\u2019s efforts to publicly mock Trump often get the result he\u2019s after.\n\nBut he\u2019s also well aware of the risks.\n\nConway: There\u2019s a double-edged sword. Like, you want people to take the danger seriously, but at the same time, you want to make clear that he\u2019s a fool.\n\nRosin: All that, after the break.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: George Conway is a well known conservative lawyer. During the Trump administration, he was considered for jobs in the Justice Department, and his then-wife, Kellyanne Conway, was, of course, Trump\u2019s very visible advisor.\n\nBut at some point, Conway started to sour on Trump while his wife was still working for the president. And then one week, in March 2019, Conway tweeted a few things about Trump\u2019s mental stability, including a picture of the official definition of narcissistic personality disorder. Trump, who you could argue had other things to do, tweeted back that Conway was a stone-cold loser, the husband from hell.\n\nConway: Which is like, Dude, why are you doing that? It\u2019s like, You should be ignoring me, right? Anybody in the White House would have told him, and I believe he was told, Ignore Conway.\n\nRosin: But he didn\u2019t. And Conway took Trump\u2019s inability to ignore him as proof that he was right because one of the hallmarks of narcissism is extreme sensitivity to criticism, an inability to ignore it.\n\nConway: Even if it\u2019s not constructive to respond to the criticism, even if it means that he\u2019s amplifying the criticism, and even if it means he is not talking about what he needs to be talking about, either as president or as a candidate\u2014\n\nRosin: That year, Conway wrote a story for The Atlantic that said Trump\u2019s narcissism made him unfit for the presidency. And he decided he would do something to help make sure he wasn\u2019t reelected. Conway had an idea\u2014a really specific, out-there idea, which came to him one day when he was listening to some strategists talk minutiae about which campaign ads to run in which markets.\n\nConway: It occurred to me that all you needed to do to drive the guy nuts was to run ads on the cable provider to the White House.\n\nAnd one day I was in my office at 52nd and 6th in New York, and my friend Molly Jong-Fast said, Hey, I\u2019m having lunch with Rick Wilson.\n\nAnd I said, Oh, can I join you? Because I wanted to meet Rick. I knew he was an ad guy. I knew he was an amazing troll of Trump, and he wrote a book about Trump. And so we had lunch. It was, like, three in the afternoon at Quality Meats on 6th Avenue. And I told him my idea.\n\nAnd he looks like his eyes lit up, because he understood immediately. And we started talking about the kinds of things you could run as audience\u2014you know, we didn\u2019t call it audience-of-one ads, but basically that\u2019s what we were talking about.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to run these ads all over the place. You don\u2019t have to run them in swing states. You could run ads that just drive him nuts by just, basically, running it in the White House.\n\nRosin: So he tried it out. It was surprisingly easy.\n\nConway: And what happened when we formed the Lincoln Project later is we took that idea, and we started running ads in Mar-a-Lago. It cost, like, $5,000 for just one spot on\u2014it was Tucker [Carlson] I think it was, or [Sean] Hannity\u2014just to run it in a very, very narrow place.\n\nRosin: That\u2019s amazing. And what were the ads?\n\nConway: The one ad that I remember he responded to was called \u201cMourning in America,\u201d M-O-U-R-N-I-N-G.\n\nAdvertisement: There\u2019s mourning in America. Today, more than 60,000 Americans have died from a deadly virus Donald Trump ignored.\n\nConway: The ad was a contrast to the \u201cMorning in America\u201d ads, the positive messages that Reagan did in 1984, except it was \u201cMourning in America.\u201d And it was like, How terrible. Everybody\u2019s out of work because of COVID, and Trump\u2019s an idiot.\n\nAnd Trump went out after watching that. I think he must have been watching it in the White House. It was on Fox News. And, like, the next day, he\u2019s at Andrews air base about to get on Air Force One, and he starts yapping about the Lincoln Project to the media, that they\u2019re calling us a bunch of losers.\n\nAnd then, you know, the next day, Lincoln Project has $4 million in contributions, or some figure like that. And it was like, that was the proof of concept.\n\nRosin: Conway has kept it up over the years. More recently, he started the Anti-Psychopath PAC, which runs these quick-cut, trolly kind of ads specifically about Trump\u2019s mental instability. There are a lot of mentions of Trump praising Hannibal Lecter, for example.\n\nThey, too, are targeted at an audience of one, and the aim is to elicit a very specific cascade of reactions.\n\nConway: Trump is somebody who could be manipulated. But you cannot control him, at the end of the day. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s just so important for people to keep hitting him with truthful descriptions of his behavior that conflict with his personal self-image, the image he wants to create.\n\nAnd it deeply wounds him. I mean, it deeply wounds him, to the point where he responds to it in a manner that, instead of talking about economics in his speech that he\u2019s supposed to be talking about economics, he\u2019s talking about who\u2019s weird and who\u2019s not weird, which is weird.\n\nRosin: All right. So you\u2019ve been doing this for a while. You\u2019ve, like, road tested the strategy that the Democrats are now using. Were you surprised, starting from the weird moment and then going through the Democratic convention, how suddenly mocking the president was politically acceptable on a stage by very dignified people?\n\nConway: Yes and no. I mean, I think they finally get it, the Democrats.\n\nThe way you win this election, I thought, is Trump has to become the issue. And once Biden stepped aside, Trump became the issue because he was the old guy in the race. And the Democrats had a fresh face, and all of a sudden people were looking more at Trump.\n\nYou know, I\u2019d like to think I had something to do with encouraging all of this, but I think they figured it out, and one way or the other. But it\u2019s something. I mean, I\u2019ve been banging the drums on this for years, and it\u2019s sort of gratifying to see it finally happen.\n\nI mean, in 2020, I was tweeting that the Democrats should hire a team of psychological professionals to advise them how to get under Trump\u2019s skin. They didn\u2019t do it then. They don\u2019t have to do it now. You don\u2019t really need shrinks to do this. You just need to, basically, you know, make fun of the guy.\n\nAnd he gives you thousands of things to make fun of, from Hannibal Lecter to sharks to electrocution to injecting bleach. You know, the guy is endlessly\u2014I mean, he\u2019s absurd. And pointing that out, you have to do it in a way that reminds people, though: He\u2019s dangerous.\n\nRosin: Yeah, that\u2019s the subtext.\n\nConway: Right.\n\nRosin: So the text is kind of a joke, mocking, trolling. The subtext is: He\u2019s dangerous. Got it.\n\nConway: Right. But it reminds me of this\u2014there\u2019s this Star Trek episode where the Enterprise is kind of held hostage by some incorporeal being, if that\u2019s the right word, that was basically causing, through its telepathy or whatever, the crew of the Enterprise to engage in conflict with one another, literally fighting each other in hallways in the various decks of the starship.\n\nStar Trek episode: The rest of our lives, a thousand lifetimes, senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us.\n\nConway: And Kirk and Spock, or one of them, realizes that the way to defeat this evil being was to start laughing at it.\n\nStar Trek episode: Cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain. I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.\n\nConway: And they started laughing at it, and all of a sudden, the being shriveled away back into space. And that\u2019s kind of like the way Trump works.\n\nRosin: Yeah. That\u2019s really good.\n\nStar Trek episode: Out! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!\n\nRosin: Well, thank you so much for walking us through that. That was really interesting. I feel like you\u2019re a prototype for what we\u2019re now seeing on a big stage. So it\u2019s just interesting to hear about your experience.\n\nConway: Thanks for having me.\n\nRosin: This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid. It was engineered by Rob Smierciak and fact-checked by Sam Fentress. Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor. I\u2019m Hanna Rosin.

            "headline": "Kamala Harris should stand with tech workers, not their bosses",
            "text": "Will either candidate keep pushing forward for labor? The answer is not so clear. Monied tech interests are lining up on both sides to advocate for looser regulation. While pro-Trump venture capitalists Andreessen and Ben Horowitz cited euphemistic \u201cbad government policies\u201d as the number one threat to the tech industry, the Silicon Valley powers that be on Harris\u2019s side haven\u2019t exactly come out swinging for labor. In fact, Hoffman said that the FTC\u2019s Khan is \u201cwaging war on American business\u201d and urged Harris to fire her.\n\nIt\u2019s not evident yet if Harris shares the views of her billionaire supporters, but she\u2019s certainly chasing their money. A recent Harris campaign fundraiser in San Francisco bagged $13 million from a guest list replete with tech executives. And the vice president is reportedly courting tech bosses more directly, sending aides to meet with crypto leaders and venture capital firms. Her ties to the industry are long-standing and often personal; she\u2019s known to be close with both former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Laurene Powell Jobs, and her brother-in-law is Uber\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\nWhile Harris\u2019s team has been having conversations and exploring options, it has not yet announced any economic agenda or approach to regulation, innovation, or labor. It\u2019s savvy to get the money first without making public promises. But Harris should be trying to court our votes, too\u2014not just our bosses\u2019 financial support. In recent memory, workers in the tech industry have demonstrated progressive energy. While campaigning in 2020, Bernie Sanders proudly voiced solidarity with workers against their billionaire bosses. And tech workers turned out for him, donating more to Bernie than to any other presidential candidate during the primaries\u2014close to twice as much as to Elizabeth Warren, the second-favorite candidate for the group. Harris could leverage that kind of power in November if she truly commits to the cause.\n\nNow is the moment for Harris to step up and make a statement in support of workers, promising to continue, if not expand upon, the Biden-Harris approach to Big Tech. Some may remember that when she ran for president in 2020, Senator Harris sided with Uber drivers and against her brother-in-law\u2019s interests during a fight about gig workers\u2019 rights in California. Unions like ours\u2014as well as any American who believes that fair labor practices are essential to a functioning democracy\u2014can continue to apply pressure on Harris and her team to take a strong stand for worker rights and protections. Indeed, the United Auto Workers (UAW) filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk after those careless comments at the Spaces event, whereas President Biden walked a picket line with striking auto workers. Voices like theirs and ours\u2014the voices of the hundreds of thousands of workers we represent\u2014will continue to be raised. If we aren\u2019t heard, we will get louder.\n\nThe stakes in November are high, and the only truly democratic future is one with fair wages, worker protections, and shared abundance. Tech elites stand in united opposition to such a future and are actively developing the AI tools to undermine it. Tech workers will continue to expand our collective power to fight those elites. The only open question is whether the next administration will be on our side or theirs.\n\nStephen McMurtry is a Google Software Engineer and Communications Chair of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA"

Alternativ sollten Versicherungen gezwungen werden, f\u00fcr die Behandlung aufzukommen. 23:21 Uhr \u2013 Ein Republikaner soll in Harris Kabinett Die demokratische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris k\u00fcndigt in ihrem ersten TV-Interview seit ihrer Nominierung an, bei einem Wahlsieg einen Republikaner in ihr Kabinett holen zu wollen. \u201eIch habe noch 68 Tage bis zur Wahl, also will ich das Pferd nicht von hinten aufz\u00e4umen\u201c, sagte die 59-J\u00e4hrige in dem Interview. Sie sei aber \u00fcberzeugt, dass es wichtig sei, dass bei den bedeutendsten Entscheidungen Leute mit am Tisch sitzen m\u00fcssten, die andere Ansichten und andere Erfahrungen h\u00e4tten, sagte Harris. \u201eUnd ich denke, dass es f\u00fcr die amerikanische \u00d6ffentlichkeit von Vorteil w\u00e4re, ein Mitglied meines Kabinetts zu haben, das Republikaner ist.\u201c 22:57 Uhr \u2013 Kennedys Name bleibt auf Stimmzetteln Trotz seines R\u00fcckzugs aus dem US-Wahlkampf und seiner Unterst\u00fctzungserkl\u00e4rung f\u00fcr den Republikaner Donald Trump wird Robert F. Kennedy bei der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl am 5. November im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat North Carolina auf den Stimmzetteln stehen. Die dortige Wahlaufsicht lehnte am Donnerstag einen Antrag seiner Partei We The People ab, Kennedys Namen von den Stimmzetteln zu streichen. Daf\u00fcr sei es jetzt zu sp\u00e4t. 22:44 Uhr \u2013 Milit\u00e4r verst\u00e4rkt Hilfe f\u00fcr Secret Service Das US-Milit\u00e4r will den Secret Service bei der Sicherung von Wahlkampfveranstaltungen in den USA st\u00e4rker unterst\u00fctzen. US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin habe einem entsprechenden Hilfeersuchen des Heimatschutzministeriums zugestimmt, teilte Pentagon-Sprecherin Sabrina Singh mit. Austin habe den Befehlshaber des n\u00f6rdlichen US-Kommandos angewiesen, die Unterst\u00fctzung des f\u00fcr den Schutz der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten und ihre Stellvertreter zust\u00e4ndigen Secret Service zu verst\u00e4rken. Dies gelte auch f\u00fcr den gew\u00e4hlten Pr\u00e4sidenten und seinen Stellvertreter nach der Wahl am 5. November bis zur Amtseinf\u00fchrung im Januar 2025. 22:06 Uhr \u2013 Vance von Feuerwehrleuten ausgebuht J.D.Vance ist bei einem Auftritt bei der Tagung Feuerwehrgewerkschaft ausgebuht worden. Die Buhrufe im Publikum ert\u00f6nten gleich zu Beginn des Auftritts des Senatos, andere Zuschauer applaudierten allerdings auch. \u201eKlingt so, als h\u00e4tten wir einige Fans und einige Hasser\u201c, sagte der 40-J\u00e4hrige bei der Konferenz in der Ostk\u00fcsten-Metropole Boston. \u201eDas ist in Ordnung. H\u00f6ren Sie sich an, was ich zu sagen habe, und ich werde meinen Standpunkt darlegen\u201c, so Vance weiter. 15:21 Uhr \u2013 Plattenfirma verbietet Trump, Abba-Songs auf Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu spielen\n\n\u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre Karrieren ausgewirkt haben\u201c, sagt Trump \u00fcber Clinton und Harris Die US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin der Demokraten, Kamala Harris, gibt zusammen mit Vizekandidat Tim Walz ihr erstes TV-Interview. Unterdessen geht Donald Trump einmal mehr unter die G\u00fcrtellinie. Erik Kirschbaum fasst die Ereignisse zusammen.\n\nDie Plattenfirma von ABBA fordert den US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Donald Trump auf, die zahlreichen Hits der schwedischen Kultband nicht mehr bei seinen Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu verwenden. Universal Music in Schweden teilte der Nachrichtenagentur AFP in einer E-Mail mit, auf Videos sei zu sehen, dass die Musik von ABBA bei mindestens einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung des Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten gespielt worden sei. \u201eWir haben verlangt, dass es heruntergenommen und entfernt wird\u201c, hie\u00df es \u00fcber das Material. Die Plattenfirma hob hervor, dass sie nicht um Erlaubnis f\u00fcr die Nutzung der ABBA-Songs gebeten worden sei. Daher habe Trump auch \u201ekeine Erlaubnis oder Lizenz\u201c daf\u00fcr.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel 50 Jahre \u201eWaterloo\u201c Abba \u2013 das Geheimnis der fantastischsten Vier\n\nVor der schwedischen Kultband hatten schon einige andere K\u00fcnstler Trump untersagt, ihre Musik zu verwenden, darunter Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Celine Dion und die Rolling Stones. 14:34 Uhr \u2013 Harris punktet bei Frauen und Hispanics \u2013 Vorsprung vor Trump w\u00e4chst Harris hat einer Reuters/Ipsos-Umfrage zufolge ihren Vorsprung zu Trump ausgebaut. Sie f\u00fchrt laut der am Donnerstag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Umfrage mit einer Zustimmung von 45 Prozent vor Trump mit 41 Prozent. Die Erhebung wurde in den vergangenen acht Tagen bis Mittwoch vorgenommen. In einer Umfrage von Reuters/Ipsos von Ende Juli hatte Harris bei registrierten W\u00e4hlern mit nur einem Prozentpunkt vor Trump gelegen. Die neue Umfrage hat eine Fehlerquote von zwei Prozent. In wichtigen Swing States hat Trump aber die Nase vorn.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl Welche globalen Trends f\u00fcr einen Sieg von Trump sprechen \u2013 und welche f\u00fcr Harris\n\nBei Frauen und hispanischen W\u00e4hlern lag Harris laut der Umfrage deutlich vor Trump \u2013 hier f\u00fchrte sie den Daten zufolge mit 49 zu 36 Prozent. Damit legte sie im Vergleich zur letzten Erhebung im Juli bei beiden Gruppen weiter zu. Trump lag dagegen bei wei\u00dfen W\u00e4hlern und M\u00e4nnern unver\u00e4ndert vorn. Es sei offensichtlich, dass das Rennen gegen Harris f\u00fcr Trump eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung sei als der Wahlkampf gegen Biden, sagte der republikanische Wahlkampf-Experte Matt Wolking. Doch sei Harris f\u00fcr Trump \u201enicht un\u00fcberwindlich\u201c. Trump m\u00fcsse vor allem darauf achten, W\u00e4hler nun nicht zu verschrecken, die in der Vergangenheit zu ihm tendierten, weil sie Biden ablehnten. 14:00 Uhr \u2013 Pressesprecher von J.D. Vance soll Verbindungen zu Rechtsextremen haben Parker Magid, der neue Pressesprecher des republikanischen Vizekandidaten J.D. Vance, hat f\u00fcr eine Beraterfirma gearbeitet, die tief verflochten mit neurechten und rechtsextremen Think-Tanks sein soll. Das berichtet der \u201eGuadrian\u201c Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet . So soll die Beraterfirma Beck & Stone fundamentale Christen unterst\u00fctzen und der \u201eSociety for American Civic Renewal\u201c nahestehen, einer Geheimloge der Far-Right-Bewegung. Einer Extremismusforscherin zufolge, die der \u201eGuardian\u201c zitiert, handelt es sich bei den mit der Beraterfirma verwobenen Organisationen um solche, die in ihren Ansichten \u00fcber den konventionellen Konservatismus weit hinausgehen. 10:23 Uhr \u2013 Fotos von deutscher Influencerin von Pro-Trump-Accounts benutzt Pro-Trump-Accounts im Online-Dienst X bedienen sich bei Social-Media-Fotos von 17 europ\u00e4ischen Frauen. Das berichtet der US-Sender CNN. Auch mindestens eine Deutsche sei betroffen. Dies habe eine Untersuchung in Kooperation mit dem Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) ergeben. Die benutzten Fotos seien auf X-Profilen ausgespielt worden, die offenbar Teil einer koordinierten Kampagne waren, welche das Trump-Vance-Lager vor den Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen unterst\u00fctzen sollte. Laut CNN-Bericht zeigt eine Analyse dutzender Pro-Trump-Konten ein systematisches Muster von \u201enicht authentischem Verhalten\u201c. Alle Konten w\u00fcrden gestohlene oder manipulierte Fotos von jungen Frauen zeigen, die ihre Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Trump in Posts erkl\u00e4rten und Hashtags wie #MAGAPatriots oder #MAGA2024 verwendeten. Die Bilder seien oftmals manipuliert worden, um auf der Kleidung Trump-Slogans zu platzieren. Es gebe keinen Hinweis darauf, dass Trump und sein Team involviert waren.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl 2024 Dumm vs. d\u00fcmmer \u2013 Harris und Trump \u00fcberbieten sich mit \u00f6konomischer Ahnungslosigkeit\n\nEiner der Fake-Accounts, der im CNN-Artikel genannt wird, hei\u00dft @Luna_2K24.

M\u00f6glicherweise illegales Verhalten k\u00f6nnte in einem Verfahren ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. 04:26 Uhr \u2013 Trump provoziert mit vulg\u00e4rem Kommentar zu Harris Donald Trump provoziert mit der Verbreitung einer vulg\u00e4ren Bemerkung \u00fcber seine demokratische Kontrahentin Kamala Harris. Trump teilte auf der von ihm mit begr\u00fcndeten Plattform Truth Social den Beitrag eines anderen Nutzers, der andeutete, dass sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten Harris\u2018 politische Karriere bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten. In dem Post ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Kamala Harris zu sehen an der Seite der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton, die 2016 im Wahlkampf gegen Trump angetreten war. Dazu der Kommentar: \u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben...\u201c\n\nDie derbe Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sex-Skandal, in den Clintons Mann Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 \u2013 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Trump-Unterst\u00fctzer wiederum verbreiten v\u00f6llig unbelegte Behauptungen \u00fcber Harris, wonach die romantische Beziehung zu einem einflussreichen Politiker in Kalifornien in den 90er Jahren ihrer Karriere geholfen habe. 00:11 Uhr \u2013 Trump-Team \u00e4u\u00dfert sich zu Vorfall auf Soldatenfriedhof Donald Trump hatte am Montag auf dem Friedhof nahe der US-Hauptstadt Washington bei einer Kranzniederlegung der vor drei Jahren bei einem Selbstmordanschlag in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten US-Soldaten gedacht. Auch einige Familienmitglieder der Opfer waren anwesend. Nun wurde bekannt, dass es bei der Visite zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen Trumps Team und Mitarbeitern des Friedhofs kam. Kritiker warfen dem republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Trump vor, er habe seinen Besuch f\u00fcr Wahlkampfzwecke missbraucht. Seine Kampagne wies das zur\u00fcck. Die US-Rundfunkorganisation NPR berichtete, zwei Trump-Mitarbeiter h\u00e4tten bei dem Besuch einen Mitarbeiter des Friedhofs beschimpft und zur Seite geschubst, als dieser Film- und Fotoaufnahmen auf einem bestimmten Teil des Gel\u00e4ndes habe unterbinden wollen. Ein Trump-Sprecher schreibt nun auf der Plattform X, ein Fotograf sei zugelassen gewesen. In einer Stellungnahme f\u00fcr NPR erkl\u00e4rte dieser weiter, der Friedhofsmitarbeiter habe wohl \u201ean einer psychischen St\u00f6rung\u201c gelitten und sich Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams physisch in den Weg gestellt.\n\nTrumps Wahlkampfteam ver\u00f6ffentlichte auf X au\u00dferdem eine Stellungnahme von Angeh\u00f6rigen der in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten Soldaten, die dem Republikaner f\u00fcr seinen Besuch dankten. Sie h\u00e4tten der Teilnahme eines Fotografen zugestimmt, und das Verhalten von Trump und dessen Team sei von gr\u00f6\u00dftem Respekt gepr\u00e4gt gewesen. Mittwoch, 28. August 21:21 Uhr \u2013 Motiv des Trump-Attent\u00e4ters wirft weiter Fragen auf Nach dem Attentat auf Donald Trump k\u00f6nnen die Ermittler noch immer keine eindeutige Aussage zum Motiv des Sch\u00fctzen treffen. Der Mann habe im Internet nach Veranstaltungen sowohl mit Trump als auch mit Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden gesucht, berichteten unter anderem die Sender NBC News und MSNBC unter Berufung auf hochrangige FBI-Beamte. Bei der Trump-Kundgebung habe es sich vermutlich um ein \u201eGelegenheitsziel\u201c gehandelt. Die Ermittler h\u00e4tten eine \u201eMischung an Ideologien\u201c ausmachen k\u00f6nnen, berichtete NBC News weiter. \u201eIch w\u00fcrde sagen, dass wir keine eindeutige Ideologie in Verbindung mit unserer Zielperson sehen, weder links- noch rechtsorientiert\u201c, zitierte das Medium einen Beamten. Man sei noch dabei, alle Spuren auszuwerten und Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen. 07:07 Uhr \u2013 Trump einigt sich mit \u201efiesestem\u201c Nachrichtensender Donald Trump verk\u00fcndet eine Einigung im Streit um das TV-Duell am 10. September mit Kamala Harris beim Nachrichtensender ABC. Bei der TV-Debatte sollen die gleichen Regeln wie beim CNN-Duell im Juni, damals noch mit Joe Biden, gelten, teilte Trump mit. Damals gab es kein Studiopublikum \u2013 und die Mikrofone waren stummgeschaltet, wenn der politische Gegner sprach. Letzteres war der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Streitpunkt und ein Wunsch von Trump. Der Republikaner bezeichnete ABC als den \u201emit Abstand fiesesten und unfairsten\u201c Nachrichtensender der Branche.

            "headline": "The History Behind Attacks on the Military Records of Politicians Like Tim Walz",
            "text": "Since Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, some Trump supporters, including Republican military veterans in Congress, have attacked his service record, accusing him of inflating his rank and avoiding combat.\n\nThese charges reflect a sordid pattern that has developed over the past two decades in which Republicans have tried to turn military service \u2014 which historically has been a strength for candidates \u2014 into a weakness, particularly for Vietnam veterans but now extending to those who fought in the Global War on Terror.\n\nThese tactics have proved successful for winning competitive elections by calling into question the character and national security bona fides of Democrats with military records. But the cost has been high, both to those attacked and their fellow veterans as well.\n\nThis process largely began in 2002 when Republican operatives began questioning the patriotism of Vietnam veteran and triple amputee Georgia Senator Max Cleland during his reelection campaign. Cleland joined the Army after college, eventually deploying to Vietnam. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Khe Sanh on June 9, 1968, winning a Silver Star \u201cfor gallantry in action.\u201d\n\nFour days later, he volunteered for a mission. As he moved across a helicopter landing pad, he reached down to pick up a grenade that he thought fell from his gear. However, a new infantryman had dropped it and not properly prepared the grenade pin. The subsequent explosion blew off both legs and an arm.\n\nFor years, Cleland fought to overcome his maiming. Even while leaving Vietnam on a stretcher, he lamented: \u201cone minute I would be utterly grateful that I was still able to see, breathe, feel and think. The next minute I would sink into despair knowing that I would never again be the man I was once was.\u201d\n\nDuring months of rehab, Cleland battled depression, while learning how to do things with his remaining arm. He learned to walk on prosthetic legs, drive a special car, and even play basketball, noting \u201cI was getting strong in the right places.\u201d As he recovered, he noted how politics became \u201cmy therapy, forcing me to get out of the house and be seen.\u201d\n\nThrough sheer determination, Cleland won a seat in the Georgia Senate (1971-1975) and then followed his fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter to Washington where he became a high-ranking administrator in what was then called the Veteran\u2019s Administration. He ultimately returned home and became Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State, a position he held for 14 years (1982-1996).\n\nRead More: What The Swifties Cost Us\n\nIn 1996, Cleland succeeded his mentor Sam Nunn in the U.S. Senate. After he won, he became a vocal advocate for veterans and the environment. Journalist David Broder stressed how Cleland \u201cembodies as much as any one person in public life can, the agonies and hopes of the last twenty years.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Republicans recruited Representative Saxby Chambliss \u2014 who had not served in Vietnam \u2014 to challenge Cleland. Chambliss proved to be a relatively lackluster candidate and through much of the race he trailed Cleland. But with control of the Senate potentially at stake, operative Rick Wilson labored to help Chambliss stage a comeback.\n\nWilson unleashed one of the most infamous attacks in the history of U.S. political campaigns. The strategist later said that \u201ceveryone assumed Cleland was immune to critiques on national security issues,\u201d but that perception didn\u2019t account for just how dirty Wilson was willing to fight. As he admitted, \u201cI have no moral center when it comes to political ads, and I will destroy the innocent and the guilty.\u201d\n\nWilson created an ad that emphasized how Cleland had voted against 11 amendments to President Bush\u2019s plan to create a Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The television spot showed photos of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, and implied Cleland had aided them with his lack of \u201ccourage to lead.\u201d In reality, he voted against the amendments because he wanted civil service protections for DHS employees.\n\nThe ad unleashed a firestorm of criticism. Cleland called it \u201cthe most vicious exploitation of a national tragedy and attempt at character assassination I have ever witnessed.\u201d The Gainesville Times (Ga.) called it \u201can irresponsible and repugnant attack on Cleland\u2019s character and sense of patriotism.\u201d Vietnam veteran Republican Senators John McCain and Chuck Hagel rallied to Cleland\u2019s defense and praised his patriotism. The former said the ad was \u201cworse than disgraceful, it\u2019s reprehensible.\u201d Chambliss pulled the spot, although he always defended it, calling it \u201clightweight\u201d and \u201cvery fair.\u201d\n\nIn the fear-drenched post 9/11 climate, however, the damage to Cleland had been done. The ad succeeded in questioning his commitment to the nation, particularly in the many parts of Georgia that unswervingly supported President George W. Bush and his War on Terrorism. Cleland lost by 130,000 votes, helping to flip the Senate. It was a devastating defeat that left Cleland bitter, disillusioned, and suffering from PTSD.\n\nThe attacks on Cleland\u2019s patriotism and military record didn\u2019t stop there either. In 2004, he strongly supported fellow Vietnam veteran, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, in his presidential campaign against Bush. The former senator openly questioned how Bush secured a prized position in the Air National Guard and whether he actually did his service. He also highlighted how Bush took time off to earn a Harvard MBA while he and Kerry went to Vietnam.\n\nConservatives pounced. Pundit Ann Coulter stressed that Cleland \u201clost three limbs in an accident during a routine non-combat mission where he was about to drink beer with friends . . . Luckily for Cleland\u2019s political career . . . he happened to do it while in Vietnam.\u201d She even questioned his Silver Star, ignoring that his actions happened before the horrible accident.\n\nOthers piled on in an effort to undercut Cleland\u2019s support for Kerry. And it wasn\u2019t just Cleland whose service the right besmirched.\n\nRead More: Watch and Read Tim Walz\u2019s Full Speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention\n\nThe group Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth (SBVT) called Kerry\u2019s service into question, aiming to negate his heroism in Vietnam where he won a Silver Star and Purple Hearts. They learned from Wilson\u2019s success and tried to turn Kerry\u2019s strength into a weakness. Much like in Georgia, it proved successful.\n\nThe attacks on Cleland and Kerry (and, a decade later, on McCain by President Donald Trump) contributed to the psychological trauma of many who fought in Vietnam by questioning their awards and military service. As one Florida veteran noted after the SBVT attacks: \u201cDo you think these awards come in a Cracker Jack box? The Department of Defense issues them with great scrutiny.\u201d He concluded: \u201cSeriously folks, this type of slander diminishes each and every veteran and their awards, and it needs to stop, NOW.\u201d\n\nBy questioning awards given to Democrats, such scurrilous tactics undermined confidence in the system that determined awards for all Vietnam soldiers. It further hurt the process of healing and reinforced the poor treatment afforded Vietnam veterans, this time in the political realm by those claiming to support service people.\n\nToday, conservatives have reverted to this old playbook to cast aspersion on Walz\u2019s 24-year National Guard career. Not surprisingly \u2014 in a parallel to the Swift Boat Veterans campaign \u2014 it is led by Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance, who served four years in the Marines as a public affairs officer. Also, it's also no surprise that Chris LaCivita, who produced the SVBT ads, is a senior Trump campaign official.\n\nIn the effort to tar Walz, conservatives have employed terms such as \"stolen valor\" and cowardice to describe his military career. At this point, the attacks appear to have had little measurable effect on Walz\u2019s popularity. However, it can take time for such lies to have an impact.\n\nRepublicans continue to attack the service of Democratic military veterans (and sometimes their own, like McCain and former Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger) because it has so much political effect. It can turn a major positive into a negative.\n\nBut the cost to American veterans has been significant. It\u2019s time that those pushing such charges get confronted with the immortal question that Army Chief Counsel Joseph Welch used to trigger the downfall of Senator Joseph McCarthy after he attacked the Army in 1954: \u201cHave you no sense of decency?\u201d\n\nKyle Longley is the Salvatori chair of history at Chapman University and author of the forthcoming (in 2025), The Forever Soldiers: Americans at War in Afghanistan and Iraq and Grunts: The American Combat Soldier in Vietnam.\n\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and edited by professional historians.

            "headline": "AN\u00c1LISIS | La entrevista de Harris con CNN es el \u00faltimo y muy esperado giro en la desenfrenada carrera presidencial",
            "text": "As\u00ed van las campa\u00f1as presidenciales en EE.UU. 5:58\n\n(CNN) -- La vicepresidenta Kamala Harris se enfrenta este jueves a la siguiente prueba en su carrera presidencial con su primera entrevista sin guion con un importante medio de comunicaci\u00f3n desde que se convirti\u00f3 en la candidata dem\u00f3crata.\n\nHarris aspira a extender el impulso que ha conjurado en el inicio de su campa\u00f1a; y evitar los tipos de errores no forzados que plagaron su primera candidatura presidencial en 2019, as\u00ed como sus primeros d\u00edas como vicepresidenta. Tambi\u00e9n es una oportunidad para que la reci\u00e9n nombrada candidata acent\u00fae el contraste con el republicano Donald Trump, conecte con los votantes indecisos y destaque sus credenciales para liderar el Despacho Oval en un momento tenso para Estados Unidos dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds.\n\nHarris aparecer\u00e1 junto a su candidato a la vicepresidencia, Tim Walz, en un programa especial en horario de m\u00e1xima audiencia de CNN que se emitir\u00e1 a las 9 pm hora del este de Estados Unidos, desde Georgia, donde se encuentra en una gira en autob\u00fas dise\u00f1ada para volver a poner en el tablero un estado indeciso que el Partido Republicano pensaba que estaba cerca de asegurar en noviembre. La entrevista es el cap\u00edtulo m\u00e1s importante de la campa\u00f1a entre la convenci\u00f3n dem\u00f3crata de la semana pasada en Chicago y el debate presidencial previsto en Filadelfia el 10 de septiembre.\n\nLa entrevista, con Dana Bash, adquiri\u00f3 una gran importancia debido a la comprimida carrera que Harris est\u00e1 llevando a cabo tras convertirse en la candidata de su partido y por la forma en que se ha convertido en un problema entre las enemistadas campa\u00f1as. Es el \u00faltimo momento de gran expectativa en una carrera desenfrenada en la que Trump se convirti\u00f3 en el primer candidato de un partido importante que fue condenado por un delito y, el expresidente sobrevivi\u00f3 a un intento de asesinato. Por su parte, la desastrosa actuaci\u00f3n del presidente Joe Biden en el debate de CNN en Atlanta desencaden\u00f3 una crisis que acab\u00f3 con su candidatura a la reelecci\u00f3n.\n\nLas grandes entrevistas televisivas, como la de este jueves, tambi\u00e9n desempe\u00f1aron un papel desproporcionado: el presidente acept\u00f3 varias en un intento de frenar su ca\u00edda, pero solo exacerbaron las preocupaciones sobre su edad y su capacidad para cumplir un segundo mandato completo.\n\npublicidad\n\nAl no programar una entrevista importante antes de ahora, Harris se expuso a las quejas de Trump y de algunos observadores no partidistas de que est\u00e1 tratando de eludir el escrutinio. Esto aumenta las posibilidades de que cualquier metedura de pata sea aprovechada por la campa\u00f1a de Trump. Sin embargo, una buena actuaci\u00f3n de la vicepresidenta supondr\u00eda otro reto para Trump, que ha pasado apuros desde que Harris transform\u00f3 la carrera al reducir su ventaja en los campos de batalla electorales y recaudar US$ 500 millones.\n\nTrump, Harris y la controversia para el pr\u00f3ximo debate 6:34\n\nA\u00f1adir sustancia a un alegre despliegue\n\nAunque Harris despert\u00f3 un intenso entusiasmo en la Convenci\u00f3n Nacional Dem\u00f3crata de Chicago la semana pasada, repleta de estrellas, as\u00ed como en alegres reuniones entre dem\u00f3cratas que antes estaban desmoralizados por las posibilidades de reelecci\u00f3n de Biden, a\u00fan tiene que entrar en un foro en el que sus respuestas y pol\u00edticas puedan ser rebatidas. Sus discursos han estado repletos de lo que quiere hacer como presidenta: desde aliviar la carga econ\u00f3mica de los estadounidenses hasta desencadenar un auge de la construcci\u00f3n de viviendas o ganar la contienda geopol\u00edtica del siglo XXI contra China. Pero la vicepresidenta no ha concretado exactamente c\u00f3mo llevar\u00eda a la pr\u00e1ctica algunas de esas aspiraciones ni c\u00f3mo las financiar\u00eda en un Washington profundamente dividido.\n\nEn la entrevista se ver\u00e1 si Harris se distancia en temas clave con Biden, ya que se presenta como una candidata del cambio a pesar de haber sido vicepresidenta en una administraci\u00f3n impopular. Harris ya ha ido m\u00e1s lejos que su jefe al comprometerse a combatir los elevados precios de los alimentos que afectan a millones de estadounidenses. Este giro populista puede ser pol\u00edticamente inteligente, pero fue criticado por muchos economistas.\n\nLa entrevista se ha convertido en un obst\u00e1culo para la vicepresidenta porque los asesores de Trump llevan semanas incit\u00e1ndola, aparentemente convencidos de que no responder\u00e1 a las preguntas dif\u00edciles, de que se quedar\u00e1 en blanco en los detalles pol\u00edticos y de que carece de instintos pol\u00edticos \u00e1giles. En un comunicado este mi\u00e9rcoles, la campa\u00f1a de Trump se burl\u00f3 de Harris, diciendo que ella hab\u00eda \"reunido el coraje para sentarse para una 'entrevista conjunta' despu\u00e9s de 39 d\u00edas de esconderse de los periodistas\". Aunque no se ha sentado para una entrevista importante, Harris ha respondido a algunas preguntas de periodistas que viajaban con ella.\n\nTras a\u00f1os como fiscal general de California y senadora que destac\u00f3 en audiencias de alto nivel, Harris ha parecido a menudo m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda haciendo preguntas penetrantes que respondiendo a ellas. Carece de las d\u00e9cadas de experiencia pol\u00edtica que ayudaron a la excandidata dem\u00f3crata Hillary Clinton, por ejemplo, a convertir las entrevistas en seminarios pol\u00edticos. Y a diferencia de Trump, no inunda a los entrevistadores con torrentes de falsedades, declaraciones escandalosas y grandilocuencia, lo que significa que \u00e9l a menudo es capaz de distraer la atenci\u00f3n de lo que realmente dice.\n\nLos republicanos est\u00e1n convencidos de que Harris quedar\u00e1 en evidencia en situaciones de alta presi\u00f3n\n\nLa confianza de los republicanos en que Harris pueda quedar en evidencia en una entrevista televisada tiene su origen en un cara a cara que mantuvo con Lester Holt, de NBC, al principio de su vicepresidencia, y que se centr\u00f3 en su papel como como emisaria ante las naciones latinoamericanas que representan la fuente de gran parte de la migraci\u00f3n indocumentada a Estados Unidos.\n\nCuando se le pregunt\u00f3 por qu\u00e9 no hab\u00eda visitado la frontera sur como vicepresidenta, Harris se\u00f1al\u00f3 que tampoco hab\u00eda visitado Europa desde que asumi\u00f3 el cargo. Su incomodidad dio lugar a a\u00f1os de ataques republicanos y la entrevista sigue pesando sobre su mandato como vicepresidenta. En aquella entrevista, Harris parec\u00eda mal preparada, una situaci\u00f3n que parece poco probable que se repita teniendo en cuenta que est\u00e1 inmersa en los preparativos del debate. En entrevistas m\u00e1s recientes, por ejemplo, en el programa \"60 Minutes\" de CBS el pasado octubre y con Anderson Cooper de CNN a finales de junio, cuando defendi\u00f3 a Biden, parec\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s tranquila.\n\nDe cara a la entrevista de este jueves, los republicanos tambi\u00e9n exigen respuestas sobre por qu\u00e9 Harris ha abandonado algunas posiciones que mantuvo en su ef\u00edmera candidatura presidencial de 2020, incluyendo \"Medicare para todos\". Su campa\u00f1a tambi\u00e9n ha indicado que ya no se opone al fracking, un tema importante en Pensilvania, donde Trump est\u00e1 destacando la industria energ\u00e9tica de carbono de la mancomunidad.\n\nLa campa\u00f1a de Trump y los medios conservadores retrataron este mi\u00e9rcoles la presencia en la entrevista de Walz, el gobernador de Minnesota, como una muleta para la vicepresidenta. Sin embargo, no es inusual que los candidatos presidenciales aparezcan con sus vicepresidentes. Trump se sent\u00f3 con su candidato a vicepresidente, el senador de Ohio, J.D. Vance, en una entrevista amistosa en Fox News el mes pasado que termin\u00f3 con un segmento de \"preguntas de los fans\". El expresidente tambi\u00e9n hizo una entrevista conjunta con el nombrado candidato a la vicepresidencia, Mike Pence, en su \u00e1tico de la Torre Trump en el programa \"60 Minutes\" en 2016. El futuro vicepresidente trat\u00f3 de matizar las posturas extremas del hombre que lo eligi\u00f3, mientras Trump no paraba de interrumpirle.\n\nHarris mantuvo una entrevista conjunta con Biden en 2020, cuando era candidata a la vicepresidencia, y la candidata dem\u00f3crata Clinton y su compa\u00f1ero de f\u00f3rmula, Tim Kaine, hicieron lo propio en 2016.\n\nDejando a un lado las disputas partidistas sobre la entrevista, hay muchas razones por las que tiene sentido que los candidatos presidenciales se sometan a duras entrevistas. Alguien que aspira a dirigir el pa\u00eds deber\u00eda sentirse en la obligaci\u00f3n de explicar lo que planea hacer, aunque sus directores de campa\u00f1a prefieran restringir sus apariciones a medios partidistas de bajo riesgo y a personas influyentes y emp\u00e1ticas en las redes sociales. Cuantas m\u00e1s entrevistas concede un pol\u00edtico, m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctica adquiere. Un plan de medios m\u00e1s s\u00f3lido podr\u00eda haber ayudado a Harris a perfeccionar sus habilidades antes de debatir con Trump.\n\nLas presidencias de \u00e9xito tambi\u00e9n se basan en el capital pol\u00edtico acumulado durante la campa\u00f1a. Puede que ya hayan pasado los d\u00edas en que las campa\u00f1as presidenciales se basaban en discursos pol\u00edticos de peso, y en esta carrera tan comprimida hay poco tiempo para tales actos.\n\nSin embargo, los candidatos presidenciales del pasado demostraron su credibilidad haciendo part\u00edcipes a los votantes de sus planes pol\u00edticos. En 1960, por ejemplo, el candidato dem\u00f3crata John F. Kennedy expuso durante la campa\u00f1a un programa sobre cuestiones como los derechos civiles, la vivienda y la pol\u00edtica exterior que se convirti\u00f3 en la base de los logros pol\u00edticos de su presidencia y de la posterior de Lyndon Johnson.\n\nLa entrevista de este jueves se produce en un momento en que los dem\u00f3cratas debaten si Harris debe concentrarse m\u00e1s en cuestiones pol\u00edticas o en establecer contrastes de car\u00e1cter con Trump, mientras dice a los votantes que tienen una oportunidad \"fugaz\" de pasar p\u00e1gina a su cacofon\u00eda.\n\nKate Bedingfield, exdirectora de comunicaciones de Biden en la Casa Blanca, dijo que Harris necesitaba aprovechar la ocasi\u00f3n para dejar claro por qui\u00e9n est\u00e1 luchando, y su promesa de proteger a los votantes de lo que ella considera ataques del Partido Republicano a sus libertades.\n\n\"Creo que no tiene que dejarse llevar demasiado por la idea de que esto tiene que ser un examen de doctorado de cada uno de los posibles puntos de un Gobierno Harris y utilizarlo realmente como una oportunidad para transmitir mensajes\", dijo Bedingfield, ahora comentarista de CNN.\n\nPero Leon Panetta, exdirector de la CIA, exsecretario de Defensa y ex secretario general de la Casa Blanca, dijo a Brianna Keilar, de CNN, que los candidatos deber\u00edan hablar de los temas en los que creen para demostrar que pueden llevar al pa\u00eds por un camino mejor.\n\nY a\u00f1adi\u00f3: \u201cM\u00e1s vale que sepan muy bien las respuestas a preguntas concretas, porque eso pondr\u00e1 a prueba si solo est\u00e1n hablando en t\u00e9rminos generales o si realmente tienen una pol\u00edtica concreta que quieren poner en marcha\"."

            "headline": "Internet helps Politico with its amnesia after it claims Vance is trying to 'tether' Biden to Harris",
            "text": "The liberal media has worked hard in recent weeks to help Democratic operatives rehabilitate Kamala Harris' public image. Essential to that effort has been her characterization as competent and capable \u2014 a task made all the more difficult by her track record as vice president and border czar over the past three years.\n\nEstablishmentarians' desperation to gloss over Harris' complicity in President Joe Biden's various failings and unpopular initiatives was crystallized in a Politico article this week, titled, \"'Our corrupt leadership': Vance tries to tether Harris to Biden during Michigan rally.\"\n\nCritics rushed to note that Vance doesn't have to do what Harris has already done \u2014 that there is a hyphen in \"Biden-Harris administration\" that both serves as a tether and cuts through the absurdity of Politico's framing.\n\nAll administration officials refer to the 'Biden-Harris administration' instead of the easier-to-say 'Biden administration.'\n\nIn fact, Politico has previously emphasized the existence of this hyphen.\n\nPolitico reported in early 2021 that:\n\nFor personnel announcements during the transition, officials were told to include quotes from both Biden and Harris. And all administration officials refer to the 'Biden-Harris administration' instead of the easier-to-say 'Biden administration.'\n\nVarious federal agencies followed suit, all making sure to tether Harris to Biden. Again, according to Politico, the \"Education Department was referring to the 'Biden-Harris administration' on its website from Day 1, with the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management following suit on Jan. 25.\"\n\nHarris has effectively been tethered to Biden since 2020.\n\n'Fast food industry tries to tie Ronald McDonald to McDonalds.'\n\nHarris' previous presidential campaign was a complete failure \u2014 so much so, she didn't even make it to the first vote. The New York Times indicated ahead of the campaign's collapse that Harris \"has proved to be an uneven campaigner who changes her message and tactics to little effect and has a staff torn into factions.\"\n\nAfter August 2019, when she was briefly polling around 10%, she took a massive nosedive in the polls and never recovered. Shortly after a poll revealed that a majority of Democrats in her own state of California wanted her to call it quits, she did so, bailing out in December 2019.\n\nBiden apparently took pity on Harris, telling reporters, \"I have mixed emotions about [her exit],\" and calling her a \"first-rate candidate.\" Ultimately, Biden permitted Harris to tether herself to him and together they proceeded to take power.\n\nIn the years since, Harris has routinely cosigned Biden's policy initiatives and decisions, including the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which Harris has boasted signing off on.\n\nDespite Harris' history of working hand in glove with Biden, Politico reported Tuesday, \"Former President Donald Trump's running mate tried to tie Harris to the Biden administration's policies \u2014 saying at one point that 'Kamala Harris has been calling the shots' \u2014 while also warning of China's emergence as an economic superpower that's taking jobs away from the U.S.\"\n\nPolitico's controversial suggestion that Vance is unfairly insinuating a link between Harris and Biden has been met with widespread ridicule as well as a community note on X.\n\nVance responded to the article on X, tweeting, \"The thing is: she's Biden's Vice President.\"\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) posted an image of the Biden-Harris 2024 logo, noting it was \"their campaign logo up and until a few weeks ago.\"\n\nBlaze News social media specialist Ben McDonald quipped, \"Fast food industry tries to tie Ronald McDonald to McDonalds.\"\n\n\"I knew the corporate press was shameless but I didn't realize that they were this stupid,\" wrote anarcho-capitalist author Michael Malice.\n\nAmid the backlash, Politico stealthily changed the title of its article without an editor's note admitting the alteration. At the time of publication, the article was titled, \"Vance warns of China\u2019s influence during Michigan rally.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

            "headline": "The Democrats Are United. Now What?",
            "text": "When Bill Clinton took the stage on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, he wasn\u2019t scanning the crowd to gauge their reaction the way he usually does. Instead, he was constantly glancing down at the dais. Clinton wasn\u2019t reading from the teleprompter; his speech had been printed out. \u201cBill Clinton is reading ... pages of actual paper,\u201d the longtime political reporter Susan Milligan tweeted. \u201cWhich, for those of us who started covering him in the \u201992 campaign, means he didn\u2019t finish his last version of his speech in time to load it on the teleprompter.\u201d\n\nClinton wasn\u2019t just fiddling with syntax. After observing the first two days of the convention, he had decided to rewrite his remarks \u201cwith a more fun, youthful, joyful approach\u201d that fit the mood he had witnessed inside the United Center. \u201cTake it from a man who once had the honor to be called in this convention the Man From Hope,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe need Kamala Harris, the president of joy, to lead us. So, I\u2019ll be doing my part. You do yours. I\u2019ll see you when we\u2019re making a real joyful noise when the votes are counted.\u201d\n\nIt was, to be blunt, not one of Clinton\u2019s better speeches\u2014long and droning, it resembled his disastrous 1988 address more than career highlights such as his reelection-shifting 1996 speech or his effusive case for Barack Obama in 2012. (It was also Clinton\u2019s thirteenth convention speech, so it\u2019s hard to fault him too much.) But it was yet another testament to the former president\u2019s well-honed ability to read the room. The theme of the 2024 convention was joy; Clinton simply put his own spin on it.\n\nMuch of that joy was Kamala Harris\u2019s. Democrats had rightly decided that exuberance was her defining characteristic, and spent four days making the case that in her the party had, at long last, its own happy warrior. But joy was also present in the United Center itself. It belonged to the delegates, too. The mood at the 2024 DNC was jubilant because everyone was well aware of how funereal things would have been if Harris wasn\u2019t the nominee. Had Biden held on, the convention would have likely taken place with Donald Trump rollicking toward a landslide return to the White House; moreover, there likely would have been massive protests against Biden\u2019s role in Israel\u2019s ongoing murder of civilians in Gaza. The media would have labeled it a reprise of the disastrous 1968 convention.\n\nInstead, Harris was the nominee; the protests were present but muted; and the Democrats, though still facing a tight election, were favorites. All of this was un-imaginable just one month earlier."

            "text": "Rumors that Beyonc\u00e9 would make an appearance were swirling inside the United Center by the third day of the Democratic National Convention. They hit TMZ a day later. But by the time balloons fell upon Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and the Democratic delegates, Beyonc\u00e9 was nowhere to be found. Nor was Taylor Swift, the subject of far less serious speculation about a \u201csurprise guest\u201d\u2014teased by dubiously sourced posters on the social media site X\u2014who failed to materialize. (Arguably, the surprise guest was actually the newly minted nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who had rocketed to the top of the Democratic ticket barely a month before.)\n\nBut attendees could hardly complain about the roster of celebrities who were in attendance. Rapper Common performed a version of his song \u201cFortunate,\u201d tailored to fit the DNC. (\u201cI thank God for this moment in time where Kamala Harris will change the world for the better with love, hope, and grace,\u201d the rapper declared.) Legendary singers Patti LaBelle and Stevie Wonder performed some of their biggest hits. Singer John Legend and drummer Sheila E. delivered a tribute to the late artist Prince that doubled as an opening act for Harris\u2019s running mate, Governor Tim Walz, who also hails from Minnesota. For the country-loving crowd, Mickey Guyton, Jason Isbell, and the Chicks all made appearances.\n\nRapper Lil Jon, a Georgia native, participated in his state\u2019s roll call vote to formally name Harris the nominee; actress Eva Longoria, who was born in Corpus Christi, did the same for Texas. (Jon performed his hit \u201cTurn Down for What\u201d but did not perform his frat-party standard \u201cGet Low,\u201d which famously details the sweat dripping down a certain anatomical region.) Pink performed alongside her daughter and backup singers for a mournful, acoustic version of her song \u201cWhat About Us.\u201d Actors Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling delivered remarks, and basketball star Stephen Curry appeared in a pretaped video; on night one, August 19, his coach, Steve Kerr, spoke about the value of teamwork. Celebrities could also occasionally be spotted on the floor of the arena: Oh look, there\u2019s Mark Hamill, there\u2019s Rosario Dawson, there\u2019s Spike Lee\u2014who looked generally more excited than he does when he sits courtside at Knicks games.\n\nOf course, convention attendees are exactly the sort of nerds who would consider a powerful politician a celebrity. Former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Barack Obama, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and Senator Elizabeth Warren were received with rapturous cheers. When 78-year-old former President Bill Clinton took the stage on night three, the reception was akin to that of fans of 81-year-old Mick Jagger; sure, he may be older and diminished, but it\u2019s Mick Jagger. (On the floor, one delegate said he would have voted for Clinton a third time if he could; several within earshot concurred.) The smorgasbord of famous people provided a sharp contrast to the Republican National Convention the month before. Democrats are generally smug about the quality and level of renown of their ideologically aligned celebrities as compared to those who support Republicans. (Unfortunately for Democrats, the U.S. Constitution does not grant George Clooney more weight in the Electoral College than your average Trump supporter.)\n\nJust one comparison: The RNC had wrestler Hulk Hogan extolling former President Donald Trump\u2019s toughness and ripping his shirt off onstage; the DNC featured a surprise speech by Oprah Winfrey. There is a measurable sociological impact of Winfrey\u2019s economic and political endorsements, aptly called the \u201cOprah Effect\u201d; if there\u2019s a \u201cKid Rock effect,\u201d it hasn\u2019t been studied yet."

Dutzende Stunden hatte sich der nationale Sicherheitsberater der USA mit Au\u00dfenminister Wang Yi und anderen Vertretern Chinas \u00fcber die vergangenen Monate getroffen. Nun betonte er die hohe Frequenz seiner \u201esehr detaillierten, sorgf\u00e4ltigen, mehrfachen\u201c Treffen, um die wiedergewonnene fragile Stabilit\u00e4t zwischen Washington und Peking aufrechtzuerhalten, insbesondere in Zeiten des Regierungswechsels.\n\nBesonders war dieser Donnerstag dann aber doch: Zum ersten Mal seit acht Jahren ist in Peking wieder ein nationaler Sicherheitsberater der USA von Staats- und Parteichef Xi Jinping empfangen worden. Zuvor traf Sullivan den Vizevorsitzenden der Milit\u00e4rkommission und dessen Stab im Hauptquartier der Volksbefreiungsarmee, die h\u00f6chste Milit\u00e4rvertretung unter Xi. Vergeblich hatte sich US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin bislang um ein Treffen mit General Zhang Youxia bem\u00fcht.\n\nXi: China nicht als Herausforderung betrachten\n\nPeking hat derzeit kein Interesse an einer weiteren Verschlechterung der Beziehungen. Das machte Xi deutlich, als er Sullivan sagte: \u201eWir hoffen, dass die Vereinigten Staaten mit China zusammenarbeiten werden, um einander entgegenzukommen\u201c. Die wichtigste Aufgabe sei \u201edie Entwicklung einer richtigen strategischen Wahrnehmung\u201c, so Xi sp\u00e4ter in der offiziellen Verlautbarung. Dazu geh\u00f6re f\u00fcr ihn, dass die USA China nicht als Herausforderung betrachten.\n\nAuf Nachfrage, ob China Sorgen vor der kommenden Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl habe, sagte Sullivan, \u201esie haben erkannt, dass Wahlen und Amts\u00fcberg\u00e4nge sensible Zeitr\u00e4ume sind\u201c. Im \u00dcbrigen sei die demokratische Kandidatin und Vizepr\u00e4sidentin Kamala Harris bereits \u201ezentrales Mitglied des Biden-Au\u00dfenpolitikteams\u201c sowie \u201ean der Gestaltung und Umsetzung der US-Indopazifikstrategie beteiligt\u201c und teile Bidens Ansichten.\n\nAngesprochen habe er auch Chinas Statusverschiebungen im S\u00fcdchinesischen Meer, in der Taiwanstra\u00dfe sowie Amerikas \u201etiefe Sorgen\u201c \u00fcber Pekings Hilfe f\u00fcr die russische Industrie. \u00dcber den Ukrainekrieg k\u00f6nne er jedoch \u201enicht sagen, dass wir da vorangekommen sind\u201c, so Sullivan.\n\nTreffen zwischen Biden und Xi m\u00f6glich\n\nEin Erfolg ist da eher die Wiederaufnahme milit\u00e4rischer Gespr\u00e4chskan\u00e4le, die Risiken vermeiden helfen sollen. China hatte die Gespr\u00e4che 2022 ausgesetzt, nachdem die damalige Sprecherin des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses, Nancy Pelosi, nach Taiwan geflogen war.\n\nNun sollen demn\u00e4chst die jeweiligen Regionalkommandeure f\u00fcr den Indopazifikraum per Video miteinander sprechen. Nach Angaben des chinesischen Verteidigungsministeriums sagte KP-Vizemilit\u00e4rkommissionschef Zhang zu Sullivan, die Welt erwarte, dass beide Seiten \u201edie Stabilit\u00e4t im milit\u00e4rischen und sicherheitspolitischen Bereich aufrechterhalten\u201c."

            "text": "Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will be tag-teaming their first major interview, spurring criticism from conservatives as well as some members of the so-called liberal media. The primetime sit-down set to air on CNN Thursday will be the first for Harris since the vice president secured the delegate votes to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cShould CNN have insisted on a one-on-one interview with Harris and turned down a joint interview with Harris and Walz?\u201d former CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller tweeted. \u201cToo tough to walk away from. But first question to Harris ought to be why should [sic] couldn\u2019t appear solo.\u201d\n\nKnoller is reinforcing the conservative talking point that Harris is unqualified and unprepared to be president. That talking point is loaded with racism and sexism, but it\u2019s also free of historical context or the clear track record of political candidates doing dual interviews with their running mates\u2014and journalists like Knoller should know better.\n\nWho could forget when Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, sat down to talk with Fox News dirtbag Jesse Watters in July? That\u2019s when Trump revealed his sorry reason for choosing the political kryptonite that is Vance. Spoiler alert: Vance was chosen because he liked Trump, \u201cmaybe more than anybody liked me.\u201d\n\nThen there was the profoundly awkward interview Trump did with his previous running mate, Mike Pence, in 2016. This was less than four years before Trump-inspired MAGA insurgents set about trying to hang the evangelical politician at the Capitol for refusing to stop the certification of electoral votes.\n\nTrump\u2019s opponent Hillary Clinton did an interview alongside her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, in 2016.\n\nRemember when Sen. Mitt Romney and his rising star Republican running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, sat down with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2012?\n\nAnd in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama sat down with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d alongside his running mate, then-Sen. Joe Biden.\n\nKeep in mind that Harris is in a unique situation because incumbent Biden announced his decision to drop out of the race a mere 38 days ago, setting the stage for her historic run. Unlike Trump, who literally never stopped campaigning (even when he became president) or any previous presidential candidate, Harris hasn\u2019t had a year or more to campaign and grant numerous interviews. Instead, she has had little more than one month to vet and choose a running mate, build a coalition of supporters in record time, hold rallies across the country, and pull off a wildly successful Democratic National Convention.\n\nConsidering Harris and Walz\u2019s excellent chemistry, Thursday night\u2019s interview should be a fun watch. Tune in to watch the joyful duo continue to trigger the hell out of right-wingers everywhere.\n\nRepublished with permission from Daily Kos."

            "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration just finished implementing some long-overdue safety precautions in Lake Michigan\u2014not to protect ships, but shipwrecks.\n\nNOAA established the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary in 2021, turning a 962-square-mile area of Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Michigan shore into a protected environmental and archaeological heritage site. Conceived as part of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s goal of promoting \u201clocally led, collaborative conservation,\u201d according to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, the sanctuary includes 36 historically significant shipwrecks, 21 of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nNow, three years later, NOAA has completed a project to install buoys and mooring lines around 19 of these shipwrecks, helping scuba divers locate them [PDF] and, more importantly, preventing functional ships from accidentally damaging their sunken brethren. Instead of dropping anchors that could damage underwater artifacts, ships can now fasten themselves to the mooring lines.\n\nCheck Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself\n\nOver 1500 wrecks are believed to lie at the bottom of Lake Michigan, and some dating as far back as the 17th century, well before the American Revolution. The Northerner, for example, was an 81-foot-long, double masted schooner used to transport lumber across Lake Michigan. The schooner made its final voyage in 1868, meeting its end as the result of an improperly plugged leak. It now lies 130 feet below the surface within the marine sanctuary.\n\nBuilt in 1851, the well-preserved schooner \u2018Northerner\u2019 lies in 130 feet of water. / Tamara Thomsen, Wisconsin Historical Society\n\nAnother noteworthy shipwreck found at the bottom of the sanctuary is the Selah Chamberlain, a 212-foot-long, engine-powered vessel that was owned and operated by a Vermont-born businessman of the same name. When it transported coal, iron ore, and wheat between Duluth, Minnesota, and Buffalo, New York, it was \u201coften seen towing a consort to further increase the carrying capacity,\u201d the Wisconsin Shipwrecks database notes.\n\nThe Selah Chamberlain met its end in 1886, when inclement weather and poor visibility caused the ship to collide with another vessel, the John Pridgeon Jr. The Selah Chamberlain cut its consort free and made for shore, but sank before it could reach land.\n\nGraveyard of the Great Lakes\n\nThese sunken ships are just a fraction of the 5000 to 10,000 wrecks believed to pepper the bottoms of the five Great Lakes.\n\nTrading vessels like the 95-foot long schooner \u2018Gallinipper\u2019 linked Wisconsin coastal cities with distant markets in the 1830s and 1840s, fueling local and regional economies. / Wisconsin Historical Society\n\nThe lakes have played a big role in North America\u2019s shipping industry, but that history is shot through with tragedy. Freshwater ice, rapidly fluctuating water levels, and the unpredictable movement of sand banks make the Great Lakes a perilous place, and that\u2019s not even including bad weather. The frequent maelstroms, formed by clashes between Arctic air flows from the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains and warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico, can cause waves 30 feet high. Many believe one of these unpredictable storms led to the mysterious wreck of the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior in November 1975. All 29 crew members died.\n\nToday, the Great Lakes sustain a vibrant ecosystem of maritime tourism and research. Because of Lake Michigan\u2019s cold, fresh water, many of the ships claimed by its waters have been incredibly well preserved, drawing attention from scuba divers and researchers alike. And thanks to NOAA\u2019s new buoying and mooring system, they are more accessible than ever.\n\nRead More Fascinating Stories About Shipwrecks:\n\nmanual"

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nLichtman, whose \"Keys to the White House\" prediction model consists of 13 true-or-false questions, said in the interview that eight keys were in Harris' favor.\n\nTrump, Lichtman said, had three keys going for him \u2014 one, Harris isn't an incumbent; two, Harris isn't, in his opinion, a \"once-in-a-generational, broadly inspirational candidate\"; and three, the Democratic Party lost control of the House during the midterm elections in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that was outnumbered by eight other keys.\n\nBesides benefiting from the positive short- and long-term economic conditions as well as legislative accomplishments under President Joe Biden's administration, Harris' candidacy wasn't dogged by any scandals or ongoing social unrest, Lichtman said.\n\nIn addition, Harris did not have to go through a primary contest to succeed Biden as nominee, he added. Lichtman said that it helped that she was facing off against Trump, who \"only appeals to a narrow base.\"\n\nHarris, he said, also didn't have a third-party challenger since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last two keys \u2014 on foreign policy failures and successes \u2014 wouldn't matter as much since Trump would still only have five keys even if they were against Harris, Lichtman said.\n\nLichtman's assessment marks a slight shift from his last prediction in July when he told The Wall Street Journal that the Democratic Party should stick with Biden if they wanted to retain the White House.\n\n\"Biden running checks off two keys right. Biden steps aside, they lose obviously the incumbency, and it's not at all clear that there wouldn't be a big party fight,\" he said then.\n\nAlthough Biden did eventually drop out, Harris was able to avert a primary contest. Besides securing Biden's endorsement, Harris was able to get her party to unite around her in short order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, Lichtman's predictions haven't always been on the money. He got the 2000 election wrong when he predicted a victory for Al Gore instead of the eventual winner, George W. Bush.\n\nThat's been the only election outcome Lichtman got wrong since he started giving predictions in the 1984 election.\n\nRepresentatives for the Harris campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours."

            "headline": "Donald Trump Says Elon Musk Will Lead \u2018Government Efficiency\u2019 Task Force",
            "text": "Donald Trump has made it known that, if elected again, he will create a \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d commission to audit the federal government\u2014an idea that was notably spawned by his pal (and, more recently, funder and unofficial campaign administrator), billionaire jackass Elon Musk. Lord help us.\n\nTrump made the remarks Thursday during a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club. \u201cAt the suggestion of Elon Musk, who has given me his complete and total endorsement\u2026I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,\u201d Trump said. \u201cElon has agreed to head the task force,\u201d Trump added while noting that the task force would be responsible for \u201cmaking recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d to the government.\n\nMusk, who originally mentioned the commission during a podcast appearance last month, made it known that he would jump at the opportunity to take the job that he made up. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help out on such a commission,\u201d he said Thursday on X. \u201cI look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises. No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.\u201d Later, Musk tweeted: \u201cThis would unlock tremendous prosperity for America.\u201d\n\nThe Journal was quick to note that such a position could represent a conflict of interest. Given the fact that multiple Musk-owned companies are currently under investigation by federal agencies, what\u2019s to stop Elon from using his \u201cefficiency\u201d commission to argue that the SEC (which is currently probing his takeover of Twitter) is \u201cinefficient\u201d and needs gutting? Indeed, handing Musk such a role gives him the perfect bureaucratic vantage point to target his enemies in government. In the past, Musk has also raged against America\u2019s National Labor Relations Board, the agency tasked with protecting America\u2019s workers from people like Musk. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine that it could also be on the chopping block.\n\nIn general, Musk\u2019s commission sounds in line with the rest of Trump\u2019s plans for a second presidency, the likes of which would likely be a windfall for America\u2019s plutocrats and a complete disaster for everybody else.\n\nLike their rightwing backers, Trump and his cronies have made a lot of noise about the need for \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d and federal spendthrift. However, voters would do well to remember that, during his first administration, Trump was hardly the picture of \u201cefficiency.\u201d Indeed, he caused one of the single biggest increases in the national debt in our nation\u2019s history (the only apparent exceptions being George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln). Trump added to the debt substantially when he pointlessly gave huge tax breaks to America\u2019s richest people, like Musk. Notably, some estimates say Trump ran the national debt up twice as much as Biden. Furthermore, analysis of Trump\u2019s new economic plan shows it would add as much as $4 trillion to the national deficit over the course of the next decade\u2014substantially more than Kamala Harris\u2019 plan.\n\nPerhaps to distract from the fact that their economic designs are basically just an Oprah-style giveaway to America\u2019s plutocratic elite, Donald Trump and his allies (including Musk) have resorted to a rather pathetic attempt to cast Kamala Harris\u2014a wealthy former prosecutor who is married to a corporate lawyer\u2014as a \u201ccommunist.\u201d Trump has spewed a near-constant stream of vitriol at Harris, repeatedly referring to her as \u201cComrade Kamala\u201d and suggesting that the rather tame economic suggestions that her campaign has made in recent weeks would put America on the path to Bolshevism. The implication here seems clear: any attempt to use the government to lessen the impact of corporate predation on everyday people is \u201ccommunism,\u201d while the path to bureaucratic virtue is paved with privatization and tax giveaways to the rich."

Electing Harris is, the executives wrote, \"the best way to support the continued strength, security, and reliability of our democracy and economy.\" They celebrated her record support of small businesses and said she would \"continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment.\"\n\nCurrent executives include Aaron Levie of Box and Jeremy Stoppelman of Yelp, as well as big names in the sports world. The NBA Hall of Famer and billionaire Magic Johnson signed on, so did Ted Leonsis, whose company owns the NBA's Washington Wizards and WNBA's Washington Mystics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome signatories, such as Murdoch and the Ripple Labs cofounder Chris Larsen, declared their support for Harris for the first time.\n\n\"Proud to support the Harris campaign \u2014 she's the right leader for our fast-changing world,\" Larsen told Business Insider in a statement. \"And I'm confident that she will reset the misguided Biden policies that were too anti-business and anti-innovation. At the same time, I'm confident she will maintain Biden's strong leadership on our energy transition.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nLarsen added that he recently donated $1 million in crypto to Future Forward, a PAC supporting Harris.\n\nOther signatories have long rallied behind the vice president. Many know her from her days in California politics, which reflects how Harris is relying on her home state for support, financial and otherwise. The veteran Harris supporters include the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs and the Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth coasts are well represented, with executives from Silicon Valley and Wall Street alike joining the effort. The angel investor Ron Conway, the entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and the LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman are among the biggest West Coast names, while former Blackstone President and CEO Tony James and the former Goldman Sachs executive Bruce Heyman hail from the world of New York finance.\n\nFormer executives at various prominent companies \u2014 including PepsiCo, Paramount, Lyft, and Starbucks \u2014 also signed on to endorse Harris.\n\nThe support from the business community comes at a crucial time, as both Harris and Trump are laying out their economic agendas ahead of Tuesday's debate.

I'm Leah Feiger, the senior politics editor at WIRED. A few months ago, a lot of people were concerned about how artificial intelligence might affect the 2024 US election. AI-generated images, audio, and video had just gotten so good and was so easy to make and spread. The WIRED politics team in our project tracking the use of AI in elections around the world actually called 2024 the year of the generative AI election. Lately, it seems like some of the panic around AI has subsided, but deepfakes of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and other politicians and their supporters are everywhere. And as we'll talk about today, legislation on political deepfakes, including AI-generated pornography, is really tricky. So with the election looming, what has changed, if anything, and how much should we really be worrying about AI? Joining me to talk about all of this are two of WIRED's AI experts. We have politics reporter Vittoria Elliott\u2014\n\nVittoria Elliott: Hi, Leah.\n\nLeah Feiger: Hey, Tori. And from Cambridge, Massachusetts, senior writer Will Knight. Will, thank you so much for coming on. It's your first time here.\n\nWill Knight: Yep. Hello. Thank you for having me.\n\nLeah Feiger: So let's start with porn, if that's OK. Tori, you have a big article out today all about US states tackling the issue of AI-generated porn. Tell us about it. How are people handling this?\n\nVittoria Elliott: It's actually really piecemeal, and that's because on a fundamental level, we don't have national regulation on this. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was herself the target of nonconsensual deepfake porn this year, has introduced the Defiance Act, which would allow victims to sue the people who create and share nonconsensual deepfake porn as long as they can show that the images or videos were made nonconsensually. And then Senator Ted Cruz also has a bill called the Take It Down Act that would let people force platforms to remove those images and videos. But there hasn't really been major movement on these in several months, and this issue has gotten a lot of attention, particularly because we've seen the spate of young people, of middle and high schoolers, using generative AI technology to bully their peers, to make explicit images and videos of their peers. And we obviously have data that shows that while generative AI is maybe still being used in politics, and we definitely have a ton of examples where it is, mostly it's used to target and harass and intimidate women."

            "headline": "Don\u2019t Underestimate Kamala Harris\u2019 Good Vibes Only Campaign",
            "text": "Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential run against Donald Trump is nearing its final act. And while Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine democracy and leveled vicious personal attacks against her, throughout the campaign so far, the public seen never seen Harris get mad\u2014in fact, she\u2019s full of joy. Her campaign is playfully tapping into the latest social media trends and memes. And rather than complaining and insulting people like Donald Trump, she\u2019s laughing and smiling on the campaign trail. \u201cThe thing we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work,\u201d she told autoworkers in Michigan.\n\nPundits have largely interpreted this as a classic expression of Black joy\u2014a form of incredible resilience in the face of the ugly challenges Black people have long faced in the U.S.\u2014or complained that joy can\u2019t substitute for smart policies (true).\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign has never suggested joy is a policy. It\u2019s a political strategy, and we\u2019re radically underestimating just how smart it is. Adopting a joyful approach has simultaneously highlighted Trump\u2019s biggest weaknesses (his age and cantankerousness), taken the spotlight off him and possibly endeared Harris to the majority of Americans who\u2019ve had enough of our country\u2019s uncivilized politics. It has also deprived Trump of the easiest line of attack he\u2019d otherwise have against Harris\u2014the same attack that Trump had against democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016: the contention that she\u2019s crazy. Expressing rage would allow him to portray Harris as such.\n\n\u201cWhen a man becomes angry in an argument or debate, people are more likely to abandon their own positions and defer to his,\u201d Soraya Chemaly writes in Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women\u2019s Anger. \u201cBut when a woman acts the same way, she\u2019s likely to elicit the opposite response.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just that people wouldn\u2019t believe Harris if she appeared angry. Women candidates often have to walk a tightrope to appear presidential without displaying characteristics that the public accepts without question from men in the public eye. \u201cMale candidates are allowed to yell, to be \u2018passionate\u2019 and volatile. It\u2019s a mark of their dedication,\u201d Gemma Hartley writes in FED UP: Emotional Labor, Women, and the Way Forward.\u201d But, for a woman, \u201ctipping anywhere near yelling means being labeled \u2018shrill,\u2019 and America has a serious problem with shrill women. Assertiveness turns from a leadership trait to a sign of instability when it is a woman on stage.\u201d\n\nAs a Black woman, Harris is especially vulnerable. From early childhood, the behavior of Black women in the U.S. has historically been carefully policed for any perceived expression of dissatisfaction. For example, Black girls are 5.5 times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. And when Black women do try to share their concerns, they\u2019re often simply ignored or written off as \u201ctoo difficult.\u201d\n\nBut eschewing anger isn\u2019t just protecting Harris from political risks. It\u2019s highlighting one of her biggest strengths: the enthusiasm with which her campaign has quickly been met.\n\nRead More: The Reintroduction of Kamala Harris\n\nWhat\u2019s more, something feels fresh and youthful about the way Harris laughs and has fun on the campaign trail. Without lobbing a single insult, it paints a massive contrast with Trump\u2019s two biggest weaknesses: he\u2019s an angry septuagenarian.\n\nThe majority of people in the U.S. \u2013 62%, to be exact\u2013 think Trump is too old to be president, according to a February ABC News/IPSOS poll. We\u2019re also tired of our country\u2019s ugly politics \u2013 literally. Some 65% of Americans always or often feel exhausted when we think about politics, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nHarris\u2019 refusal to rebut Trump\u2019s mean insults and inaccurate claims \u2013 most famously, when she was asked in a CNN interview about Trump\u2019s contention that she isn\u2019t Black and responded that he was using the \u201csame old tired playbook\u201d before asking for the next question\u2014is likely to appeal to voters who want more civility in our politics.\n\nThis approach is also undermining one of Trump\u2019s main strategies on the campaign trail and as president: picking arguments with people. \u201cIt has long been clear that no spectacle is more absorbing than a fight,\u201d Tim Wu wrote in The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside our Heads, which is why one of Trump\u2019s signature strategies has been \u201ccontinuous warfare.\u201d\n\nBy not responding to his attacks, Harris isn\u2019t participating in the spectacle. That\u2019s had the effect of taking a lot of media attention off Trump\u2014one of the most devastating things she could do to him personally and politically. Recall that the continuous coverage the media gave Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign\u2014largely because his unorthodox tactics made for good entertainment\u2014is one of the major things that helped him win that election. But this year, Harris is getting plenty of media attention of her own.\n\nOf course, joy isn\u2019t why voters should cast their ballots for Harris\u2014they should be examining her policies, which she\u2019s continuing to roll out on the trail and which are already having an impact on voters. (For example, low income voters now significantly favor Harris over Trump \u2013 a huge change from June, when they favored Biden by a mere 3 percentage points, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released this week.) But this campaign tactic is making Harris a more formidable political candidate\u2014and signaling to voters that she\u2019ll go about getting things done in new, strategic ways."

            "headline": "Exclusive: Florida U.S. Senate challenger launches WhatsApp channel to reach voters",
            "text": "Democrats launch text message campaign in Florida Senate race to reach Latino voters\n\ntoggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nDebbie Mucarsel-Powell, the former U.S. House Democrat now challenging Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott for the Senate, has launched a new campaign on WhatsApp to reach voters and attack a sea of disinformation.\n\nThe direct messaging operation is part of a broader attempt to close the gap in a race that has grown increasingly tight. Democrats face an uphill battle undoing Republican gains in the state in recent years, particularly in an election where former President Trump is expected to add to GOP turnout in the state. However, Democrats think they can move the needle, particularly with Latino voters, through smartphones.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's particularly created to target Latino voters across the state to provide them with accurate, factual information coming straight from the source,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell, the sole Latina candidate running for U.S. Senate this year, told NPR.\n\nThe Scott campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe messaging campaign includes two channels on the messaging platform WhatsApp \u2014 one in English and another in Spanish.\n\nThe effort also coincides with a similar launch by the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, which now has its own bilingual channel to reach Latino voters. In their case, the Harris campaign said it was a first-of-its kind in a presidential contest.\n\nThe encrypted platform is a free messaging app that is particularly popular among immigrants, and especially Latinos, to communicate through texts and calls domestically and internationally. With campaigns increasingly looking to use the app, they hope their network will grow with voters as updates are shared by users.\n\nMucarsel-Powell argues WhatsApp will let her directly reach Florida\u2019s Hispanic community, often a target of disinformation. A Pew Research report found 46% of Hispanic Americans use the messaging program compared to a quarter of Americans. It\u2019s used by 23% of Black Americans and 16% of white Americans, the group found.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's very easy to forward, and it's actually one of the reasons why there's been so much disinformation, because of that easy feature, the easy forwarding feature,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell said. \u201cAnd so we wanted to have our own channels to allow our own supporters to just forward the contact to their networks across the state.\u201d\n\nMucarsel-Powell is Democrats\u2019 first Spanish-speaking candidate for U.S. Senate in Florida. And the WhatsApp effort is part of an overall campaign strategy to reach Latino voters who sat out previous elections, which includes dozens of English and Spanish language campaign events so far as well as ads in both languages.\n\nBOLD PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, has identified the Florida Senate race as a top target to address disinformation and reach Latino voters. In the last presidential election in 2020, Mucarsel-Powell and others raised alarm with congressional members over misinformation on WhatsApp and Facebook that was reaching voters.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that Republicans have helped spread misinformation through their campaigns, while Republicans have argued the opposite.\n\nMucarsel-Powell\u2019s campaign faces a tough challenge trying to unseat Scott, the first-term senator now seeking re-election after previously serving as Florida governor.\n\nNow the home state Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump, Florida has largely turned red in recent years. However, Democrats argue their voters have been energized by the Harris presidential campaign and national issues, such as abortion access, which will be on Florida's November ballot."

            "headline": "Hackers Threaten to Release Stolen Data From Planned Parenthood of Montana",
            "text": "Planned Parenthood of Montana announced on Wednesday a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d that was first identified on August 28, according to a new report from Cyberscoop. The healthcare organization had roughly 93 gigabytes of data stolen by hackers affiliated with RansomHub, who are reportedly giving Planned Parenthood until September 11 to pay an undisclosed amount or have all of the data leaked online.\n\nMartha Fuller, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana, said in a statement to EM360Tech that the organization \u201cimmediately implemented our incident response protocols, including taking portions of our network offline as a proactive security measure.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what kind of data has been stolen and it\u2019s unknown whether patient files have been impacted. Planned Parenthood offers a wide range of health services, but mainstream American perceptions typically associate the organization only with providing abortion care. Whatever is ultimately leaked, if that does come to pass, will almost certainly become a political football in today\u2019s highly politicized environment.\n\nStarted in February 2024, RansomHub works under a \u201cransomware-as-a-service\u201d model, encrypting and exfiltrating data from at least 210 known victims, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Those 2010 victims have been in some of the most sensitive areas of national infrastructure and anything else that helps society run smoothly, according to the CISA, including, \u201cwater and wastewater, information technology, government services and facilities, healthcare and public health, emergency services, food and agriculture, financial services, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing, transportation, and communications critical infrastructure sectors.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood acknowledged the existence of the claims by RansomHub that it hacked the healthcare group but didn\u2019t confirm or deny RansomHub was actually behind the attack.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the RansomHub post, and want to assure our community that we are taking this matter very seriously,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cWe have reported this incident to federal law enforcement, and will support their investigation.\u201d\n\nAbortion is a vitally important issue in American life, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2022 to overturn 50 years of legal precedent by abolishing the federal right to an abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade. The Dobbs decision has been a disaster for human rights in the U.S. and many Americans are understandably upset about having their rights stripped of them.\n\nAnd it\u2019s for that reason many political pundits believe abortion will be a key factor in this November\u2019s election. After all, former president Donald Trump was instrumental in taking away those rights by appointing three Supreme Court justices with views completely outside the mainstream. Trump is currently trailing his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, who notably supports abortion rights, in the key battleground states that will decide the election.\n\nPlanned Parenthood said on Wednesday that the group is working to restore its systems but there\u2019s no timeline on when that may happen.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to our IT staff and cyber security partners, who are working around the clock to securely restore impacted systems as quickly as possible, and who are tirelessly investigating the cause and scope of the incident,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThat investigation is ongoing.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Montana didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions sent Thursday. Gizmodo will update this post when we hear back."

            "text": "'I let him talk, I'm gonna let her talk,' Trump says ahead of ABC News debate\n\nFormer President Donald Trump participated in another town hall Wednesday where he took several shots at his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris' record and continued to throw out falsehoods about her and his record in office in front of a friendly crowd in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvisers point to events like this as how Trump is preparing for next week\u2019s ABC News debate in Philadelphia against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe former president, who often downplays the need for formal debate preparations, did offer some insight into how he will approach sharing the debate stage with Harris, saying he would limit his outbursts during an audience Q &A portion of the event which will air later this week.\n\n\u201cWhen I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion. And I let him talk. I\u2019m gonna let her talk,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity when asked how he will respond to Harris when she tries to get under his skin.\n\n\u201cThere are those who say that Biden is smarter than she is. If that\u2019s the case, we have a problem,\u201d Trump said, attacking Harris\u2019 intelligence earlier by claiming she has \u201cno idea what the hell she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can go in with all the strategy you want but you have to sort of feel it out as the debate is taking place,\u201d he said, going on to talk about his multiple debate appearances.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d Trump quipped, quoting former boxing champion Mike Tyson.\n\nTrump zeroed in on what he characterized as Harris\u2019 policy inconsistencies, something that advisers have encouraged him to focus on. He specifically highlighted her changed position on fracking in front of a crowd in one of the country\u2019s top fossil fuel-producing states.\n\nFormer US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) takes part in a town hall moderated by Fox News broadcaster Sean Hannity at the New Holland Arena in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on September 4, 2024.

She said it 100 times, there will be no fracking. There will be no fracking. There will be no fracking. Then just recently, she said, \u2018Yes, I could approve fracking.\u2019\u201d Trump continued, \u201cLook, this is a woman who is dangerous. I don't think it's too smart, let's see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can't take the chance. You have no choice. You've got to vote for me, even if you don't like me,\u201d he said, arguing that Americans didn\u2019t know enough about Harris.\n\nTrump held a town hall in Wisconsin last week with former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard was recently named to Trump\u2019s presidential transition team and has been advising him during his debate preparations.\n\nWednesday\u2019s town hall, which was taped in the afternoon before airing during Hannity\u2019s regular 9 p.m. ET time slot, comes in lieu of a debate that Fox was attempting to hold tonight. While debate invitations were sent to both candidates, only Trump accepted as Harris campaign officials said future debates are contingent on Trump showing up to the ABC News debate next week.\n\n\u201cI think he's a nice guy,\u201d Trump said, pointing to Hannity. \u201cBut I would have preferred a debate.\u201d\n\nThe former president and Hannity repeatedly criticized Harris\u2019 lack of interviews as reasons to argue she\u2019s unfit for office, pushing unfounded claims about her interview with CNN last week. However, while Trump sat down with Hannity for longer than Harris\u2019 CNN interview, it was a friendly hour with the conservative TV host who rarely pushed back or pressed Trump on a number of topics.\n\nTrump was asked to detail the differences between his previous presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt's not that different. It's still about the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. People are being treated horribly in this country.\u201d\n\nTrump continued to spread anti-immigrant rhetoric, accusing Venezuelans of \u201ctaking over the whole town\u201d in Aurora, Colorado, as he again promised to oversee the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cTake a look at Aurora. In Colorado, where Venezuelans are taking over the whole town. They're taking over buildings, the whole town\u2026They're knocking down doors and occupying apartments of people. The people are petrified. And it's getting worse and worse,\" Trump said, referring to a viral video that appeared to show an armed mob roaming around an apartment complex in Aurora.\n\nHowever, the Aurora Police Department vehemently denied accusations that the apartment complex is being run by a Venezuelan gang.\n\n\u201cWe've been talking to the residents here and learning from them to find out what exactly is going on, and there's definitely a different picture,\" Interim Police Chief Interim Heather Morris said in a Facebook video the department posted last week, while adding, \"I'm not saying that there's not gang members that don't live in this community.\"\n\nThe City of Aurora also provided clarity on the situation in a post on X, saying while there was a concern about a \u201csmall\u201d presence of the Venezuelan gang members in Aurora, the city is taking the situation seriously. The city stressed that Aurora is a \u201csafe community\u201d and that reports of gang members are \u201cisolated to a handful of problem properties alone.\u201d\n\nTrump criticized Harris\u2019s rhetoric after Hannity played a 2016 clip of Harris from a speech at a Los Angeles mosque, in which she urged the public not to use terms such as \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cillegal alien.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants to be politically correct, and we can't be politically correct,\u201d Trump responded.\n\n\u201cYou need a president that's not going to be taking you into war. We won't have World War III when I'm elected, but with these clowns, you're going to end up having world war \u2013 it's going to be a war like no other.\u201d\n\nHannity briefly mentioned at the top of his program the school shooting earlier in the day in Winder, Georgia, where two students and two teachers were killed and nine people were injured. Trump cited Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to tout his record on crime and national security.\n\n\u201cWell, it's a sick and angry world for a lot of reasons, and we're going to make it better. We're going to heal our world. We're going to get rid of all these wars that are starting all over the place, and we're going to make it better,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cYou know, Victor Orban made a statement. They said, \u2018Bring Trump back, and we won't have any problems.\u2019 He was very strong about that.\u201d\n\nTrump also took time to defend himself and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, against Harris\u2019 running mate Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s argument that they\u2019re \u201cweird.\u201d Trump fired back at that sentiment, poking fun at some of Walz\u2019s quirks.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s weird with that guy. He's a weird guy. JD is not weird. He's a solid rock. I happen to be a very solid rock,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe're not weird. We're other things, perhaps, but we're not weird. But he is a weird guy.\u201d"

            "text": "'I let him talk, I'm gonna let her talk,' Trump says ahead of ABC News debate\n\nFormer President Donald Trump participated in another town hall Wednesday where he took several shots at his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris' record and continued to throw out falsehoods about her and his record in office in front of a friendly crowd in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvisers point to events like this as how Trump is preparing for next week\u2019s ABC News debate in Philadelphia against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe former president, who often downplays the need for formal debate preparations, did offer some insight into how he will approach sharing the debate stage with Harris, saying he would limit his outbursts during an audience Q &A portion of the event which will air later this week.\n\n\u201cWhen I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion. And I let him talk. I\u2019m gonna let her talk,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity when asked how he will respond to Harris when she tries to get under his skin.\n\n\u201cThere are those who say that Biden is smarter than she is. If that\u2019s the case, we have a problem,\u201d Trump said, attacking Harris\u2019 intelligence earlier by claiming she has \u201cno idea what the hell she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can go in with all the strategy you want but you have to sort of feel it out as the debate is taking place,\u201d he said, going on to talk about his multiple debate appearances.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d Trump quipped, quoting former boxing champion Mike Tyson.\n\nTrump zeroed in on what he characterized as Harris\u2019 policy inconsistencies, something that advisers have encouraged him to focus on. He specifically highlighted her changed position on fracking in front of a crowd in one of the country\u2019s top fossil fuel-producing states.\n\nFormer US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) takes part in a town hall moderated by Fox News broadcaster Sean Hannity at the New Holland Arena in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on September 4, 2024.

She said it 100 times, there will be no fracking. There will be no fracking. There will be no fracking. Then just recently, she said, \u2018Yes, I could approve fracking.\u2019\u201d Trump continued, \u201cLook, this is a woman who is dangerous. I don't think it's too smart, let's see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can't take the chance. You have no choice. You've got to vote for me, even if you don't like me,\u201d he said, arguing that Americans didn\u2019t know enough about Harris.\n\nTrump held a town hall in Wisconsin last week with former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard was recently named to Trump\u2019s presidential transition team and has been advising him during his debate preparations.\n\nWednesday\u2019s town hall, which was taped in the afternoon before airing during Hannity\u2019s regular 9 p.m. ET time slot, comes in lieu of a debate that Fox was attempting to hold tonight. While debate invitations were sent to both candidates, only Trump accepted as Harris campaign officials said future debates are contingent on Trump showing up to the ABC News debate next week.\n\n\u201cI think he's a nice guy,\u201d Trump said, pointing to Hannity. \u201cBut I would have preferred a debate.\u201d\n\nThe former president and Hannity repeatedly criticized Harris\u2019 lack of interviews as reasons to argue she\u2019s unfit for office, pushing unfounded claims about her interview with CNN last week. However, while Trump sat down with Hannity for longer than Harris\u2019 CNN interview, it was a friendly hour with the conservative TV host who rarely pushed back or pressed Trump on a number of topics.\n\nTrump was asked to detail the differences between his previous presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt's not that different. It's still about the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. People are being treated horribly in this country.\u201d\n\nTrump continued to spread anti-immigrant rhetoric, accusing Venezuelans of \u201ctaking over the whole town\u201d in Aurora, Colorado, as he again promised to oversee the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cTake a look at Aurora. In Colorado, where Venezuelans are taking over the whole town. They're taking over buildings, the whole town\u2026They're knocking down doors and occupying apartments of people. The people are petrified. And it's getting worse and worse,\" Trump said, referring to a viral video that appeared to show an armed mob roaming around an apartment complex in Aurora.\n\nHowever, the Aurora Police Department vehemently denied accusations that the apartment complex is being run by a Venezuelan gang.\n\n\u201cWe've been talking to the residents here and learning from them to find out what exactly is going on, and there's definitely a different picture,\" Interim Police Chief Interim Heather Morris said in a Facebook video the department posted last week, while adding, \"I'm not saying that there's not gang members that don't live in this community.\"\n\nThe City of Aurora also provided clarity on the situation in a post on X, saying while there was a concern about a \u201csmall\u201d presence of the Venezuelan gang members in Aurora, the city is taking the situation seriously. The city stressed that Aurora is a \u201csafe community\u201d and that reports of gang members are \u201cisolated to a handful of problem properties alone.\u201d\n\nTrump criticized Harris\u2019s rhetoric after Hannity played a 2016 clip of Harris from a speech at a Los Angeles mosque, in which she urged the public not to use terms such as \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cillegal alien.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants to be politically correct, and we can't be politically correct,\u201d Trump responded.\n\n\u201cYou need a president that's not going to be taking you into war. We won't have World War III when I'm elected, but with these clowns, you're going to end up having world war \u2013 it's going to be a war like no other.\u201d\n\nHannity briefly mentioned at the top of his program the school shooting earlier in the day in Winder, Georgia, where two students and two teachers were killed and nine people were injured. Trump cited Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to tout his record on crime and national security.\n\n\u201cWell, it's a sick and angry world for a lot of reasons, and we're going to make it better. We're going to heal our world. We're going to get rid of all these wars that are starting all over the place, and we're going to make it better,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cYou know, Victor Orban made a statement. They said, \u2018Bring Trump back, and we won't have any problems.\u2019 He was very strong about that.\u201d\n\nTrump also took time to defend himself and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, against Harris\u2019 running mate Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s argument that they\u2019re \u201cweird.\u201d Trump fired back at that sentiment, poking fun at some of Walz\u2019s quirks.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s weird with that guy. He's a weird guy. JD is not weird. He's a solid rock. I happen to be a very solid rock,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe're not weird. We're other things, perhaps, but we're not weird. But he is a weird guy.\u201d"

            "headline": "Conflicting messages from Trump and his campaign highlighted in Arlington incident",
            "text": "Trump deputy campaign manager identified in Arlington National Cemetery dustup\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nOne of two staffers involved in the altercation at Arlington National Cemetery is a deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump\u2019s reelection bid, NPR has learned. The former president insisted this week the incident did not happen, highlighting a growing disconnect between the messaging of the candidate and his campaign. NPR is identifying both staffers after the campaign\u2019s conflicting responses to the incident last week outside Section 60 of the cemetery, where many casualties of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.\n\nThe two staffers, according to a source with knowledge of the incident, are deputy campaign manager Justin Caporale and Michel Picard, a member of Trump\u2019s advance team.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCaporale is a one time aide to former first lady Melania Trump who left the White House to work for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before returning to the Trump campaign. He was also listed as the on-site contact and project manager for the Women for America First rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 where Trump urged the crowd to \u201cstop the steal\u201d before some of them stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAfter Trump participated in a wreath laying ceremony on the third anniversary of the deadly bombing at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members, Trump visited Section 60 at the invitation of some family members and friends of the fallen soldiers.\n\nANC rules, that had been made clear to the Trump campaign in advance, say that only an official Arlington photographer can take pictures or film in Section 60. When an ANC employee tried to enforce the rules, she was verbally abused by the two Trump campaign operatives, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. Picard then pushed her out of the way according to two Pentagon officials.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s conflicting messaging on the incident\n\nAfter NPR first reported the altercation last week, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said they were \u201cprepared to release footage\u201d of the incident, and attacked the Arlington employee as someone \u201cclearly suffering from a mental health episode.\u201d Cheung also said they were granted access to have a photographer present, and pointed to a statement from Gold Star family members that invited Trump to attend the ceremony.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe campaign also released a TikTok video that included video footage from Section 60, including a smiling Trump flashing a thumbs up with family members at the gravesites. But other tombstones are visible in the picture, and at least one family of a fallen Green Beret has confirmed they did not give permission for his grave to be filmed or used in a campaign ad.\n\nThe Army released a statement last Thursday acknowledging that a cemetery employee \u201cwas abruptly pushed aside\u201d and the campaign was warned ahead of time of the prohibition against photography and political activities at Arlington. The Army said the cemetery employee tried to de-escalate the situation after she was pushed, in hopes of not upsetting the Gold Star families in attendance.\n\nThe Army said a police report of the incident was filed, but that the employee had declined to press charges, and that the Army considered the matter closed, but added that \u201cthe ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked.\u201d\n\nWhen NPR emailed both Caporale and Picard, Cheung responded, \u201cI see you've been emailing some of our team members\u2026As the Army has said, they consider this matter closed. President Trump was there to support the Gold Star families and honor the sacrifices their loved ones made.\u201d\n\nCheung also included a social media post that shows a Biden campaign ad from 2020 that used images of the then-vice president at the cemetery in 2010 .\n\nNeither Cheung, Picard or Caporale responded to emailed requests for comment as of publication time. Reached by phone, Caporale referred questions to Cheung. The Trump campaign has still not followed through on its pledge to release video of the incident, despite repeated requests from NPR.\n\nThis week, Trump contradicted his own campaign with a post on Truth Social falsely calling the confrontation a \u201cmade up story by Comrade Kamala and her misinformation squad\u201d that attacked Harris and Biden for not attending the private ceremony.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn an interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show Tuesday, Trump reiterated the false assertion that nothing happened at the cemetery, questioning the motives of the unnamed employee and downplaying the accusations as attacks over \u201cpublicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you notice that the person represented now doesn\u2019t want to talk, he doesn\u2019t want to speak or talk?\u201d Trump asked, mislabeling the employee as male. \u201cThe nice thing, the beautiful thing, was all the parents and relatives got together and they said \u2018That\u2019s a false story, it was totally false.\u2019\u201d\n\nFormer President Trump polls well among veterans , and has many vocal supporters with military ties. Some of the family members who invited him to Arlington also spoke at the Republican National Convention, bashing Biden and vocally endorsing Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden may have forgotten that our children died, but we have not forgotten \u2014 Donald Trump has not forgotten,\" said Cheryl Juels in Milwaukee at the RNC in July. Juels is the aunt of Sgt. Nicole Gee, one of the service members killed at Abbey Gate in 2021, during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal.\n\n\"Joe Biden owes the men and women that served in Afghanistan a debt of gratitude and an apology. Donald Trump loves this country and will never forget the sacrifice and bravery of our service members,\" she added. \"Join us in putting him back in the White House.\"\n\nBut those families do not have the power to suspend the rules at Arlington, where Section 60 is a fresh and on-going memorial to hundreds of recent war dead that, like the rest of the cemetery, is meant to be above politics.\n\nThe family of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a Green Beret who died by suicide after serving multiple combat tours and who is buried in Section 60, said according to their conversations with the cemetery, \"the Trump campaign staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We hope that those visiting this sacred site understand that there were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected and treated accordingly,\" they said in a statement.\n\nJimmy McCain, a US Marine whose father was the late senator John McCain, also condemned the visit .\n\nTrump has a history of controversial remarks about the military - he insulted Sen. John McCain for being a prisoner of war. He allegedly called dead soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" and recently stoked controversy for saying civilian Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients are much better than those who received the Medal of Honor \u2014 the highest military award in the country, often given posthumously.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s conflicting messaging on the campaign trail\n\ntoggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe incident at Arlington National Cemetery is the latest example of conflict between the messaging efforts of Trump\u2019s campaign and the candidate himself since President Biden ended his reelection bid and Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s attempts to use the bombing anniversary to attack Harris over the Afghanistan withdrawal, complete with videos from Gold Star family members blaming the administration for the deaths of their loved ones, has been overshadowed by the politicization of Arlington and its hallowed status.\n\nLast week, both Trump and campaign staff sought to clean up his stance on abortion rights and a ballot measure in his home state of Florida. Trump initially seemed to signal support for the proposed amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and posted that his second term would be \u201cgreat for women and their reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nAfter backlash from anti-abortion advocates and a statement from the campaign saying that Trump did not say how he would vote on the referendum, Trump eventually told a Fox News reporter he would vote against it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump has also publicly questioned the rules, format and fairness for next week\u2019s debate even as his campaign accepted the conditions and has worked behind the scenes to iron out details.\n\nIn a town hall conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity Wednesday, Trump called debate host ABC News \u201cdishonest\u201d and implied without evidence that Harris would get questions in advance.\n\nThe debate will be a pivotal moment for Trump to try and regain momentum against Harris, who has erased Trump\u2019s onetime commanding lead in the polls in the seven key battleground states."

            "headline": "Trump plans New York press conference after hearing appeal arguments in sexual abuse case",
            "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Shortly after appearing in court for an appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, Donald Trump stepped in front of television cameras Friday and brought up a string of past allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct, potentially reminding voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten.\n\nThe former president has made hitting back at opponents and accusers a centerpiece of his political identity, but his performance at his namesake Manhattan office tower was startling even by Trump's combative standards.\n\nAt times, he seemed to relish using graphic language and characterizations of the case brought by advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, which could expose the former president to further legal challenges from Carroll's attorneys. His remarks were especially striking given that they came four days before Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris, with early voting about to begin in some parts of the country and Election Day just two months away.\n\nTrump is doing his best to stay in the public eye while Harris prepares for the debate in private, meeting with her advisers in Pittsburgh. That\u2019s a reflection of their divergent campaign styles, with Trump frequently engaging with reporters \u2014 albeit often in friendly settings \u2014 while Harris has done just one interview and no news conferences since taking President Joe Biden\u2019s place atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nHis team had billed Friday's appearance as a press conference and Trump repeatedly brought up Harris\u2019 lack of news conferences. But Trump took no questions and instead talked about the cases against him for an hour while hardly mentioning any campaign issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president, and I have all these cases all of a sudden come,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re fake cases.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign raised tens of millions of dollars off his previous indictments, convictions and appearances in court. But it\u2019s unclear how focusing on his legal woes will help him now as he works to win over undecided voters \u2014 including independents and those on the fence in critical swing states, ahead of a critical debate on Tuesday that will likely draw tens of millions of viewers.\n\nTrump has disregarded his aides' advice to focus on policy\n\nTrump's trying to seize the political offensive by bringing up allegations against him recalled 2016 when, in the weeks before Election Day, he attempted to dismiss as simple \u201clocker room talk\u201d a recording of him bragging about grabbing, forcibly kissing and sexually assaulting women, which triggered subsequent allegations of misconduct by a string of women.\n\nBut on Friday, standing inside Trump Tower, where he lived for decades before moving to Florida, Trump had many moments that evoked a more distant past.\n\nHe suggested women have accused him of wrongdoing because he is famous. He made a trio of references to how he was already famous in some circles in the 1970s, and talked about his work in the real estate and construction worlds in the 1980s \u2014 before millions of today's voters were born. At one point, he referenced the New York Post's famous \u201cPage Six\u201d gossip section, whose writers have spent decades covering him, as being the internet of its day.\n\nTrump called Carroll's case against him \u201cMonica Lewinsky Part II,\u201d referencing the then-White House intern who had a sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton, and recalled an infamous dress that played a pivotal role in the late-1990s impeachment proceedings against Clinton.\n\nThe former president also repeatedly implied he would not have assaulted two of his accusers due to their looks. He said of a woman who has accused him of sexual misconduct on a plane in the 1970s \u201cshe would not have been the chosen one,\u201d and of Carroll, \u201cI never touched her. I would have had no interest in meeting her in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nHarris, a former California attorney general, says frequently of her opponent's criminal record, \u201cI know Donald Trump's type.\u201d She had no public schedule as she continued debate preparation on Friday, but has built her campaign partly around the idea of prosecuting the case against him \u2014 and the accusations Trump brought up Friday could give her more lines of political attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters and aides have urged him to focus on policy contrasts with Harris instead of personal attacks during the final stretch of a race that remains extremely close.\n\nBut, as Trump spoke, two of his top political advisers were on a call with Republican members of Congress, criticizing the media as being too soft on Harris while saying they felt confident about the race for the White House. Instead, the former president was flanked by his lawyers, some of whom also spoke in defense of their client.\n\nTrump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major candidate\n\nHis comments came after Trump was in court to hear his lawyers argue for overturning a jury's $5 million verdict finding him liable of sexually abusing Carroll in 1996.\n\nJuries now have twice now awarded Carroll huge sums for Trump's claiming she made up a story about him attacking her in a department store dressing room to help her sell a memoir. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from continuing to make nearly identical statements to reporters. On Friday, he said again that Carroll was telling a \u201cmade up, fabricated story.\u201d\n\nCarroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, warned in March after a jury awarded Carroll another $83 million that she would continue to monitor Trump\u2019s comments and would consider suing again if he kept it up. In a speedy response to his Friday comments at Trump Tower, Kaplan said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say it again: All options are on the table.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Trump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major-party nominee.\n\nHe has separately been convicted on 34 felony counts in a New York state case related to hush money payments allegedly made to a porn actor. The judge in that case announced separately Friday that he would postpone sentencing until after Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nTrump has also been ordered to pay steep civil fines for lying about his wealth for years.\n\nAnd he\u2019s still contending with cases alleging his mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 though none are likely to go to trial prior to Election Day."

            "headline": "Right-Wing Influencers Like Tim Pool Allegedly Paid by Kremlin Influence Campaign",
            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department revealed a Russian influence campaign and charged two RT employees with two counts of conspiracy in an unsealed indictment on Wednesday. According to the indictment, two employees of the Kremlin-run media company RT spent $10 million on right-wing media personalities and poisoning the well of American discourse.\n\nThe two Russians, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva funneled money into a Tennessee-based media company to get the job done. The indictment doesn\u2019t name the company or the media personalities it hired, but it\u2019s not hard to use clues in the court documents to figure out everyone involved. The unsealed indictment quotes the company\u2019s description of itself on its own website as a \u201cnetwork of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one company based in Tennessee with that phrase on its website: TENET Media. TENET Media is an outlet that publishes on YouTube and other social media. It has paid for videos from people like Benny Johnson, Tim Pool, David Rubin, Matt Christiansen, and Lauren Southern.\n\nWhat kind of content did Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva get for their $10 million? \u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s indictment, Russian state broadcaster RT and its employees, including the charged defendants, co-opted online commentators by funneling them nearly $10 million to pump pro-Russia propaganda and disinformation across social media to U.S. audiences,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.\n\nThe most watched video on TENET Media\u2019s YouTube channel is a documentary from Southern about online dating. The second most popular is Southern talking about the great replacement conspiracy theory. Its most recent video is a 12-minute long low-effort rant from Benny Johnson about Kamala Harris. So far it has less than five thousand views.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Pool, Johnson, and the rest were making decent money churning out content for the site. In 2022, Tenet went looking for people to be the face of the operation. \u201c\u2018For the right candidate we\u2019re willing to pay around $1-2 million per year,\u2019\u201d they said, according to court records. That\u2019s a lot of cash for videos that would go on to routinely net under ten thousand views.\n\nThe founders reached out to two commentators\u2014believed to be Tim Pool and either Benny Johnson or David Rubin\u2014and asked them how much they\u2019d need to come work for them. \u201cFounder-I advised that Commentator-I said \u2018it would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,\u2019 and that Commentator-2 said \u2018it would take 100k per weekly episode to make it worth his while,\u2019\u201d the indictment said.\n\nThe indictment made clear that Pool, Rubin, Johnson, and the rest didn\u2019t know that they were being sponsored by the Russians. The three have all released statements in the past 24 hours claiming that they, themselves, were victims.\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed by the allegations in today\u2019s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,\u201d Johnson said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cThese allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme,\u201d Rubin said on X. \u201cI knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.\u201d\n\nPool emphasized that the charges are allegations and, like the others, said he was a victim. \u201cThat being said, we still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,\u201d Pool said in a post on X. \u201cPutin is a scumbag, Russia sucks donkey balls.\u201d He later deleted the post. Pool has been vocal in opposing U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the indictment, all three men made hundreds of thousands of dollars making videos for TENET media. One creator made $400,000 a month on top of a $100,000 signing bonus. Again, that\u2019s a lot of cash for videos no one was watching.\n\nThe unsealed indictment was just one of several coordinated announcements from Washington on Wednesday aimed at striking back against Russia for election interference. The Treasury said it would sanction 10 individuals and two entities as part of the effort. In addition to the indictment, the DoJ announced the seizure of 32 internet domains it said spread disinformation using AI.\n\nDisinformation campaigns are a staple of modern geopolitics. Countries like the U.S., China, Russia, and Iran all spend money manipulating the media of their friends and rivals. In February of this year, Reuters reported that the U.S. military spread anti-vax propaganda in the Philippines during the pandemic with the goal of undermining China. Earlier this month, Microsoft accused Iran of running disinformation campaigns in the U.S.\n\nDisinformation campaigns are not always subtle and, if discovered, can undermine the intended message. Modern Russian campaigns are odd though, they\u2019re often designed with the knowledge that they\u2019ll be discovered. Russia isn\u2019t always interested in convincing people of any one thing, it\u2019s more about making everyone paranoid and distrustful. The knowledge that RT, and by extension the Kremlin, paid for Pool, Johnson, and Rubin to make videos is destabilizing in itself, regardless of the content they generate.\n\nReuters reached out to RT for comment on the indictment and RT gave them a statement that can be read as both a flippant joke and bizarre promise. \u201cThree things are certain in life: death, taxes, and RT\u2019s interference in the US elections,\u201d RT told Reuters."

Dabei handelt es sich wohl um einen Witz, wie F.A.Z.-Korrespondent Friedrich Schmidt schreibt:\n\n\n\nSchon im Februar hatte Putin Joe Biden als vorzugsw\u00fcrdig gegen\u00fcber dem seinerzeit noch voraussichtlichen Kandidaten der Republikaner, Donald Trump, bezeichnet, da der Amtsinhaber \u201eerfahrener\u201c und \u201evorhersehbar\u201c sei.\n\n\n\nIn Anspielung darauf sagte Putin am Donnerstag auf seinem allj\u00e4hrlichen Wirtschaftsforum in Wladiwostok in Russlands Fernem Osten, Biden sei, soweit man \u00fcberhaupt von \u201eFavoriten\u201c sprechen k\u00f6nne, da \u201enicht wir das zu bestimmen haben\u201c, sondern das \u201eamerikanische Volk\u201c, Russlands \u201eFavorit\u201c gewesen. Nachdem Biden nun nicht mehr \u201eim Rennen\u201c sei, aber seinen Mitstreitern empfohlen habe, Harris zu unterst\u00fctzen, \u201ewerden also auch wir das machen, werden wir sie unterst\u00fctzen\u201c, sagte Putin zur Erheiterung von Publikum und Moderatorin und l\u00e4chelte dabei sarkastisch.\n\n\n\nDass Harris \u201eansteckend lacht\u201c, zeige, \u201edass bei ihr alles gut ist\u201c, fuhr Putin im selben Ton fort. Trump dagegen habe in dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft so viele \u201eBeschr\u00e4nkungen und Sanktionen\u201c gegen Russland verh\u00e4ngt wie zuvor kein amerikanischer Pr\u00e4sident. \u201eWenn bei Frau Harris alles gut ist, unterl\u00e4sst sie wom\u00f6glich solche Handlungen\u201c, sagte Putin. Letztlich habe \u201edas amerikanische Volk die Wahl, und mir werden diese Wahl respektieren\u201c.\n\n\n\nAm Mittwoch hat das amerikanische Finanzministerium neue Sanktionen gegen russische Staatsmedien wie den Sender RT, dessen Chefin Margarita Simonjan und weitere Personen aus dessen Umfeld verh\u00e4ngt und dies mit Versuchen begr\u00fcndet, die Pr\u00e4sidentenwahlen im November zu beeinflussen. Generalstaatsanwalt Merrick Garland sagte bei der Vorstellung von Vorw\u00fcrfen gegen zwei demnach in Russland ans\u00e4ssige RT-Mitarbeiter, es gehe Moskau darum, die Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr die Ukraine zu diskreditieren.\n\n\n\nUnter anderem habe RT mit fast zehn Millionen Dollar ein Unternehmen im amerikanischen Bundesstaat Tennessee gegr\u00fcndet, um auch unter Mitwirkung heimischer Influencer Russlands Interessen verdeckt voranzutreiben. Laut dem Sender CNN gehen amerikanische Geheimdienste weiterhin davon aus, dass Moskau einer neuerlichen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft Trumps den Vorzug geben w\u00fcrde."

            "text": "The Federal Trade Commission sued earlier this year to prevent the deal.\n\nA possible $24.6 billion deal between supermarket rivals, Kroger and Albertsons, has hit another roadblock with the U.S. government, but the CEO has pledged to cut prices by $1 billion on day one to try and save the proposed deal.\n\nAfter the U.S. government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the deal, chief executive of the nation's third-largest general retailer Rodney McMullen took the stand in a federal courtroom in Oregon on Wednesday as part of a three week hearing to defend the merger with Albertsons.\n\nKroger CEO Rodney McMullen leaves federal court after testifying during a federal court hearing, Sept. 4, 2024, in Portland, Ore. Jenny Kane/AP\n\nMcMullen argued that the move would allow the company to drop prices and compete with bigger retail companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco.\n\nThe definitive merger agreement was first announced in October 2022 and last month the Federal Trade Commission, and states of Colorado and Washington, filed a lawsuit to stop the merger, arguing it would \"eliminate competition\" in the 22 states where the companies currently compete and raise grocery prices for millions during a time when Americans are already paying more due to high inflation on food.\n\nA Kroger grocery store. Jonathan Weiss/Adobe Stock\n\nOn Wednesday, McMullen said Albertsons prices are 10 to 12% higher than that of Kroger's and argued that the merged company could aim to shrink that gap in its new strategy to retain customers.\n\nIf combined, Albertsons and Kroger would control around 13% of U.S. grocery sales, which is still short of Walmart that currently controls nearly 22%.\n\nCincinnati-based Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter.\n\nBoise-based Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.\n\nAn Albertsons grocery store in Lafayette, La. Adobe Stock\n\nIf the deal does go through, it would be the largest grocery chain merger in U.S. history.\n\nFood prices continues to come up as a recurring topic for politicians, with Vice President Kamala Harris saying on the campaign trail that if elected President, she would crack down on prices.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has campaigned on inflation and recently reminded the public that grocery prices increased by more than 20% under President Joe Biden.\n\nMore details will emerge from the multi-court hearing on the proposed grocery chain merger, which will include upcoming testimony from Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran."

That office is across the hallway.\n\nAn hour before, in Galveston, the suspect, Athir Samir Murady was escorted into the Galveston Police Department by officers, after leaving a nearby hospital following Tuesday\u2019s shooting, chase, and arrest.\n\nAthir Samir Murady\n\nMurady\u2019s name also showed up on the state security portal database - having several affiliations with private security companies and security-related firms.

            "text": "Trump gets criminal sentencing delayed till after presidential election\n\ntoggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nA New York judge on Friday delayed the sentencing in a criminal case against former President Donald Trump in order to ensure the court is seen as politically impartial.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan set the new sentencing date for Nov. 26, a few weeks after the election. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide payments to an adult film star.\n\n\u201cThe imposition of sentence will be adjourned to avoid any appearance\u2014however unwarranted\u2014that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate,\u201d Merchan said in his decision. \u201cThe Court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMerchan also postponed consideration on whether to overturn the criminal conviction in light of a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity and other evidence. That hearing is now set for Nov. 12.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision on July 1 came after Trump was convicted in New York \u2014 but before he was sentenced. The timing threw into disarray what was already an unprecedented felony conviction against a former president and current Republican presidential nominee.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers say the Supreme Court decision means his case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, should be cleared entirely.\n\n\"The Manhattan D.A. Witch Hunt has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was NO CASE, I DID NOTHING WRONG!\" Trump posted on the Truth Social website. \"It is a political attack against me.\"\n\nTrump's legal team argued that various testimony, such as that of former White House employees, and evidence, like statements made while he was president, violate the Supreme Court ruling that decided presidents have immunity for official acts they take in office.\n\nHis lawyers have spent the summer trying to blunt the case\u2019s impact on the election, in part by accusing Merchan of political bias. They\u2019ve asked Merchan to overturn the conviction, appealed it, sought to delay the sentencing until after the election, and remove Merchan and move the case to federal jurisdiction.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA spokeswoman for the district attorney, Danielle Filson, said the DA's office \"stands ready for sentencing on the new date set by the court.\"\n\n\"A jury of 12 New Yorkers swiftly and unanimously convicted Donald Trump of 34 felony counts,\" she said in a statement.\n\nFundraising tool\n\nNew York jurors in May unanimously agreed that Trump falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nEven without a delay in his sentence, Trump has sought to use the conviction as a fundraising tool. Within 24 hours of the guilty verdict, Trump\u2019s campaign boasted of raising millions of dollars. Since officially being named GOP presidential nominee, he has continued to discuss the trials at various campaign events.\n\nThe jury heard from 22 witnesses during about four weeks of testimony in Manhattan\u2019s criminal court. Jurors also weighed other evidence \u2014 mostly documents like phone records, invoices and checks to Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s once-loyal \u201cfixer,\u201d who paid Daniels to keep her story of an alleged affair with the former president quiet.\n\nThe facts of the payments and invoices labeled as legal services were not in dispute.\n\nWhat prosecutors needed to prove was that Trump falsified the records in order to further another crime \u2014 in this case, violating the New York election law that makes it a crime for \u201cany two or more persons [to] conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\u201d\n\nThe jurors were able to choose whether those unlawful means were violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, falsifying tax returns or falsifying other business records.\n\nThe verdict came more than a year after a grand jury indicted Trump on March 30, 2023, marking the first time a former or sitting president faced criminal charges.\n\n\u2014With assistance from Franco Ordo\u00f1ez."

            "text": "US-Wahlkampf Regeln f\u00fcr Duell zwischen Trump und Harris stehen fest Stand: 05.09.2024 07:44 Uhr\n\nNach langem Hin und Her haben sich die Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Trump und Harris auf die Regeln f\u00fcr das erste TV-Duell geeinigt. Offenbar gab das Harris-Lager nach. Daf\u00fcr bekommt die Demokratin neue Unterst\u00fctzung aus den republikanischen Reihen.\n\nDie demokratische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris und ihr Kontrahent Donald Trump haben sich auf die Regeln f\u00fcr das mit Spannungen erwartete erste TV-Duell geeinigt. Der Sender ABC ver\u00f6ffentlichte die Bedingungen f\u00fcr das Fernsehformat.\n\nVorausgegangen war ein Streit \u00fcber die Mikrofone. Konkret ging es um die Frage, ob diese stumm geschaltet werden, wenn der politische Gegner spricht. Ein Sprecher des Wahlkampfteams der Demokratin Harris hatte vergangene Woche mitgeteilt, dass man es bevorzuge, dass die Mikrofone beider Kandidaten w\u00e4hrend der gesamten \u00dcbertragung angeschaltet blieben. Trump hatte sich dar\u00fcber aufgeregt und indirekt damit gedroht, die ganze TV-Debatte abzublasen.\n\nEs scheint nun eine Einigung zu geben: So sollen w\u00e4hrend des TV-Duells die Mikrofone desjenigen, der gerade nicht spricht, stummgeschaltet werden. Dabei hat nun offenbar Harris klein beigegeben.\n\nSchl\u00fcsse aus letztem Duell gegen Biden\n\nDie Republikaner d\u00fcrften aus dem TV-Duell mit dem damaligen demokratischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerber, US-Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden, im Juni gelernt haben. Auch damals waren die Mikrofone desjenigen, der gerade nicht sprach, stummgeschaltet. Nach der Debatte kamen Beobachter aber zu dem Schluss, dass Trump die stumm geschalteten Mikros eher geholfen h\u00e4tten, weil der 78-J\u00e4hrige so kontrollierter gewirkt habe.\n\nDer Sender ABC k\u00fcndigte an, dass die Debatte 90 Minuten dauern werde, zwei Werbepausen seien geplant. Es soll keine Er\u00f6ffnungsstatements geben, die Schlusserkl\u00e4rungen der Kandidaten sollen zwei Minuten dauern. \"Requisiten oder vorformulierte Notizen sind auf der B\u00fchne nicht erlaubt\", teilte ABC weiter mit. Harris und Trump w\u00fcrden einen Stift, einen Block Papier und eine Flasche Wasser erhalten.\n\nTrump s\u00e4te bereits vorab Zweifel an der Unparteilichkeit des Senders. \"ABC ist der schlechteste Sender, wenn es um Fairness geht\", sagte Trump im Gespr\u00e4ch beim Senders Fox News. Ohne Belege zu nennen, behauptete Trump, er habe geh\u00f6rt, Harris w\u00fcrde die Fragen von ABC vorab bekommen. Die Debatte findet am 10. September statt.\n\nLiz Cheney und Jimmy McCain wollen f\u00fcr Harris stimmen\n\nBei der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl am 5. November l\u00e4uft es auf ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen zwischen Harris und Trump hinaus - in Umfragen liegen sie etwa gleichauf. Nun hat sich auch die prominente US-Republikanerin Liz Cheney f\u00fcr Harris ausgesprochen.

            "text": "Die demokratische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris und ihr Kontrahent Donald Trump haben sich auf die Regeln f\u00fcr das bevorstehende TV-Duell geeinigt - doch der Republikaner s\u00e4t schon vorab Zweifel an der Unparteilichkeit des Senders, der die Debatte austr\u00e4gt. \u00abABC ist der schlechteste Sender, wenn es um Fairness geht\u00bb, sagte Trump im Gespr\u00e4ch mit dem Talkmaster Sean Hannity des Senders Fox News. Ohne Belege zu nennen, behauptete Trump, er \u00abhabe geh\u00f6rt\u00bb Harris w\u00fcrde die Fragen von ABC vorab bekommen.\n\nHarris zieht im Mikrofon-Streit den K\u00fcrzeren\n\nZuvor hatte ABC die Regeln f\u00fcr das mit Spannung erwartete erste Fernsehduell zwischen Trump und Harris ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Vorausgegangen war ein Streit \u00fcber die Mikrofone. Konkret ging es um die Frage, ob diese stumm geschaltet werden, wenn der politische Gegner spricht. Hier scheint es nun eine Einigung zu geben: So sollen w\u00e4hrend des TV-Duells am 10. September (Ortszeit/11. September MESZ) die Mikrofone desjenigen, der gerade nicht spricht, stummgeschaltet werden.\n\nDas hei\u00dft, Harris hat klein beigegeben. Sie wollte, dass die Mikrofone beider Kandidaten w\u00e4hrend der gesamten \u00dcbertragung angeschaltet bleiben. Ihr Team lie\u00df wissen, dass man darauf setze, dass sich Trump nicht \u00ab90 Minuten lang pr\u00e4sidial verhalten kann\u00bb. Nun schrieb ihr Wahlkampfteam an den Sender ABC, dass das nun vereinbarte Format die 59-J\u00e4hrige benachteilige. Ungeachtet der Bedenken stimme man aber den Regeln zu, da man f\u00fcrchte, dass Trump sonst das TV-Duell abgesagt h\u00e4tte, hie\u00df es in dem Brief, der US-Medien vorlag.\n\nAn dieser Stelle ist ein externer Inhalt eingebunden Zum Anschauen ben\u00f6tigen wir Ihre Zustimmung Bitte aktivieren Sie JavaScript damit Sie diesen Inhalt anzeigen k\u00f6nnen. Weiter\n\nTV-Duell zwischen Biden und Trump wirkt nach\n\nTrump d\u00fcrfte aus dem TV-Duell mit dem damaligen demokratischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerber, US-Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden, im Juni gelernt haben. Damals waren die Mikrofone desjenigen, der gerade nicht sprach, stummgeschaltet. Die Stummschaltung soll Berichten zufolge auf Bidens Team zur\u00fcckgegangen sein. Damit h\u00e4tten die Demokraten verhindern wollen, dass Trump den 81 Jahre alten Demokraten st\u00e4ndig unterbreche. Nach der Debatte kamen Beobachter aber zu dem Schluss, dass Trump die stumm geschalteten Mikros eher geholfen h\u00e4tten, weil der 78-J\u00e4hrige so kontrollierter gewirkt habe. Bidens Auftritt hingegen war ein Desaster - und hatte seinen R\u00fcckzug aus dem Rennen zur Folge.\n\nTrump hatte sich dar\u00fcber aufgeregt, dass Harris diese Regeln nun \u00e4ndern wollte und indirekt damit gedroht, die ganze TV-Debatte abzublasen. Die damalige Debatte zwischen Trump und Biden wurde vom als liberal geltenden US-Sender CNN ausgerichtet, nun ist ABC an der Reihe. Trump nannte den Sender im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Hannity \u00abunehrlich\u00bb und verwies auf eine Freundschaft zwischen Harris und einer Managerin des Senders. Der Republikaner sagte, er habe nur zugestimmt, weil Harris' Team auf den Sender bestanden habe. Der 78-J\u00e4hrige hatte der Debatte bereits vor Monaten zugestimmt, damals war Biden noch im Rennen.\n\nStift, Papier und Wasser sind erlaubt\n\nABC k\u00fcndigte nun an, dass die Debatte 90 Minuten dauern werde, zwei Werbepausen seien geplant. Es soll keine Er\u00f6ffnungsstatements geben, die Schlusserkl\u00e4rungen der Kandidaten sollen zwei Minuten dauern. \u00abRequisiten oder vorformulierte Notizen sind auf der B\u00fchne nicht erlaubt\u00bb, teilte ABC weiter mit. Harris und Trump w\u00fcrden einen Stift, einen Block Papier und eine Flasche Wasser erhalten. Trump behauptete nun in der Sendung bei Fox News, dass Harris gefordert habe, Notizen mit in das Duell nehmen zu d\u00fcrfen.\n\nAn dieser Stelle ist ein externer Inhalt eingebunden Zum Anschauen ben\u00f6tigen wir Ihre Zustimmung Bitte aktivieren Sie JavaScript damit Sie diesen Inhalt anzeigen k\u00f6nnen. Weiter\n\nTownhall bei Fox News ohne Zuschauerfragen\n\nBei Trumps Gespr\u00e4ch mit Hannity am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) handelte es sich um eine sogenannte Townhall. Bei einem solchen Format sind auch Fragen aus dem Publikum zugelassen. In der rund einst\u00fcndigen Sendung auf Fox News, die im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat Pennsylvania aufgezeichnet wurde, kam aber kein Zuschauer zu Wort. \u00abThe Hill\u00bb berichtete, entsprechende Zuschauerfragen an Trump sollten am Donnerstag ausgestrahlt werden. In der Sendung am Mittwoch lobte Hannity den republikanischen Kandidaten \u00fcber den gr\u00fcnen Klee. Er sagte etwa: \u00abSie haben einen hohen Preis daf\u00fcr gezahlt, dass Sie in die politische Arena eingestiegen sind.\u00bb Trump w\u00fcrde von der Justiz verfolgt, obwohl er sich eigentlich ein sch\u00f6nes Leben machen k\u00f6nnte, sagte Hannity.\n\nFox News war eine Zeit lang etwas von Trump abger\u00fcckt - und unterst\u00fctzte eher den damaligen republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerber Ron DeSantis. Mittlerweile steht der Sender aber wieder eisern hinter Trump. Aktuell ist nicht geplant, dass Fox News eine TV-Debatte im Wahlkampf ausrichtet. Es k\u00f6nnte durchaus sein, dass die Debatte auf ABC die einzige zwischen Trump und Harris bleiben wird. Nach Bidens Ausstieg aus dem Rennen war der ganze Plan f\u00fcr die ausgehandelten TV-Debatten \u00fcber den Haufen geworfen worden.\n\nKnappes Rennen erwartet\n\nBei der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl am 5. November l\u00e4uft es auf ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen zwischen Harris und Trump hinaus - in Umfragen liegen sie etwa gleichauf. Der geringe Abstand zwischen beiden Kandidaten liegt im Bereich der Fehlertoleranz. Allerdings hat das Rennen mit Harris' \u00dcbernahme der Kandidatur neuen Schwung gewonnen. Trump hatte der Wechsel bei den Demokraten augenscheinlich etwas unvermittelt getroffen - er schien sich auf seinen politischen Erzfeind Biden eingeschossen zu haben und arbeitet nun an einer neuen Strategie. Er wirft Harris vor, eine radikale Linke zu sein.\n\nAm Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) meldete sich eine altbekannte Trump-Kritikerin zu Wort: Die Republikanerin Liz Cheney k\u00fcndigte an, bei der Wahl f\u00fcr Harris stimmen zu wollen. Die Ansage ist keine wirkliche \u00dcberraschung. Dass eingefleischte Republikaner aber \u00f6ffentlich dazu aufrufen, Demokraten zu w\u00e4hlen, ist schon sehr ungew\u00f6hnlich. Gleichzeitig freute Trump sich dar\u00fcber, dass der Bruder des demokratischen Vizekandidaten Tim Walz sich kritisch \u00fcber diesen ge\u00e4u\u00dfert hatte. Entsprechende Facebook-Posts von Jeff Walz hatten zuletzt f\u00fcr Aufmerksamkeit gesorgt.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240905-930-223368/4"

            "text": "Wladiwostok (dpa) \u2013 Vor der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl in den USA hat Kremlchef Wladimir Putin seine angebliche Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Kandidatin Kamala Harris erkl\u00e4rt. Die US-Politikerin habe so ein ausdrucksstarkes und \u00abansteckendes Lachen\u00bb, das zeuge davon, dass f\u00fcr sie alles gut sei, sagte Putin beim \u00d6stlichen Wirtschaftsforum in Wladiwostok am Pazifik.\n\nEr habe immer gesagt, dass er US-Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden favorisiere. Putin hatte gelobt, dass Biden berechenbarer sei als sein Vorg\u00e4nger Donald Trump. Da Biden aus dem Wahlkampf herausgenommen worden sei und sich nun f\u00fcr Harris einsetze, \u00abwerden wir sie auch unterst\u00fctzen\u00bb. Die Wahl sei aber beim US-amerikanischen Volk, sagte Putin.\n\nDer 71-J\u00e4hrige \u00e4u\u00dferte sich im Beisein von Malaysias Regierungschef Anwar Ibrahim bei einer Plenarsitzung zu Fragen des Welthandels und zur internationalen Politik. Der Kremlchef kritisierte, dass besonders auch unter Trump US-Sanktionen gegen Russland erlassen worden seien. \u00abTrump hat so viele Beschr\u00e4nkungen und Sanktionen gegen Russland verh\u00e4ngt, wie kein Pr\u00e4sident vor ihm. Und wenn es Frau Harris gut geht, wird sie vielleicht von dieser Art von Ma\u00dfnahmen absehen\u00bb, sagt er unter Hinweis auf ihr Lachen.\n\nWashington: Putin soll sich aus unseren Wahlen heraushalten\n\n\u00abHerr Putin sollte aufh\u00f6ren, \u00fcber unsere Wahlen zu sprechen\u00bb, sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrates, John Kirby, angesprochen auf Putins \u00c4u\u00dferung. Er solle niemanden bevorzugen. Nur die amerikanischen W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hlern w\u00fcrden entscheiden, wer der n\u00e4chste US-Pr\u00e4sident werde. \u00abWir w\u00fcrden es sehr zu sch\u00e4tzen wissen, wenn Herr Putin aufh\u00f6ren w\u00fcrde, \u00fcber unsere Wahlen zu reden und aufh\u00f6ren w\u00fcrde, sich in sie einzumischen\u00bb, so Kirby weiter.\n\nDie US-Regierung wirft Russland eine Einmischung in die bevorstehende Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl im November vor. Die USA belegten am Mittwoch mehrere Personen und Organisationen mit Sanktionen, darunter Vertreter des staatlichen russischen Senders RT (fr\u00fcher Russia Today), wie das Finanzministerium und Justizminister Merrick Garland in Washington mitteilten. Garland sagte, der innere Kreis rund um Putin habe russische PR-Firmen angewiesen, \u00abDesinformation und staatlich gef\u00f6rderte Narrative als Teil einer Kampagne zur Beeinflussung der US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen 2024 zu f\u00f6rdern\u00bb.\n\nUSA werfen Russland Wahleinmischung vor\n\nSchon bei fr\u00fcheren US-Wahlen hatte sich Moskau nach Angaben offizieller amerikanischer Stellen eingemischt. Nach Ansicht der US-Geheimdienste setzte sich Russland bei der Wahl 2020 f\u00fcr den Republikaner Trump ein und bem\u00fchte sich, dem Demokraten Biden zu schaden. Moskau habe den Ausgang der Wahl beeinflussen und Unfrieden im Land s\u00e4en wollen, hie\u00df es in einem ver\u00f6ffentlichten Geheimdienst-Bericht.\n\nAuch bei der Wahl 2016 hatte Russland nach \u00dcberzeugung der US-Sicherheitsbeh\u00f6rden zugunsten des Kandidaten Trump interveniert, um die Demokratin Hillary Clinton auszubremsen. Ein Sonderermittler untersuchte sp\u00e4ter m\u00f6gliche illegale Absprachen zwischen Russland und Trumps Team. Daf\u00fcr gab es keine ausreichenden Hinweise.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240905-930-223749/2"

            "text": "US-Republikaner f\u00fcr Harris Unterst\u00fctzung aus dem gegnerischen Lager Stand: 07.09.2024 01:53 Uhr\n\nNicht alle Republikaner unterst\u00fctzen ihren US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten - einige warnen sogar vor Trump. Und manche gehen noch weiter: Sie unterst\u00fctzen \u00f6ffentlich seine Gegnerin Harris. Ist das ein Grund zur Sorge f\u00fcr Trump?\n\nSie werde alles tun, um die R\u00fcckkehr von Donald Trump ins Wei\u00dfe Haus zu verhindern, sagt Liz Cheney seit Monaten. Und nun hat die prominente Republikanerin angek\u00fcndigt, nicht einfach nur nicht f\u00fcr Donald Trump zu stimmen, sondern seine Gegnerin, die Demokratin Kamala Harris, im Rennen ums Wei\u00dfe Haus zu unterst\u00fctzen - aufgrund der Gefahr, die Donald Trump darstelle.\n\nDie Tochter von Ex-Vize-Pr\u00e4sident Dick Cheney hat nun au\u00dferdem erkl\u00e4rt, dass auch ihr Vater f\u00fcr Kamala Harris stimmen werde. Liz Cheney hatte sich seit dem Angriff auf das US-Kapitol 2021 offen gegen Trump gestellt, verlor deshalb am Ende ihre F\u00fchrungsrolle in der republikanischen Partei und ihren Sitz im Abgeordnetenhaus. Liz Cheney war eine von nur zwei Republikanern im Untersuchungsausschuss zum Sturm auf das US-Kapitol.\n\nLiz Cheney (links) und ihr Vater (Archivbild aus August 2022): Dick Cheney war unter George W. Bush von 2001 bis 2009 Vize-Pr\u00e4sident der USA.\n\nRepublikaner auf dem Demokraten-Parteitag\n\nDer zweite war Adam Kinzinger. Auch der ehemalige Abgeordnete warnt seitdem vor Trump und unterst\u00fctzt Harris \u00f6ffentlich. In der ABC-Late Night Show Jimmy Kimmel sagte Kinzinger vor einigen Tagen, seine Partei sei aus den Fugen geraten und verteidige die Demokratie nicht mehr.\n\nAuf dem Parteitag der Demokraten trat Kinzinger auf, als einer von mehreren republikanischen Rednern. Der ehemalige Vize-Gouverneur von Georgia, Geoff Duncan, nutzte die B\u00fchne, um an seine Parteifreunde und an unentschlossene W\u00e4hler zu appellieren, Harris zu w\u00e4hlen. Die republikanische Partei sei nicht mehr b\u00fcrgerlich oder konservativ. Sie sei chaotisch und verr\u00fcckt. Das einzige was \u00fcbrig bleibe, sei Trump fallenzulassen - \"Dump Trump\", so Duncan.\n\nDer republikanische Ex-Kongressabgeordnete Adam Kinzinger spricht auf dem Parteitag der Demokraten. Auch Trumps ehemalige Pressesprecherin Stephanie Grisham hielt dort eine Rede.\n\nBeispiellos - und wahlentscheidend?\n\nAndere Republikaner wie Trumps damaliger Vizepr\u00e4sident, Mike Pence, verwehren Trump ihre Unterst\u00fctzung, gehen aber nicht so weit, dazu aufzurufen, Harris zu w\u00e4hlen. Dass namhafte Republikaner wie Liz Cheney das tun, sei absolut beispiellos in den USA, sagt Politikwissenschaftler Chris Edelson von der American University in Washington.\n\nDiese einzigartige Situation k\u00f6nne einen Einfluss auf das Wahlergebnis haben, vor allem mit Blick auf die wahlentscheidenden Swing States, in denen Trump und Harris in Umfragen sehr eng beieinanderliegen, so Edelson. Selbst wenn Liz Cheney in einem Swing State - Bundesstaaten, die mal republikanisch, mal demokratisch w\u00e4hlen und deshalb besonders umk\u00e4mpft sind - nur ein paar Tausend W\u00e4hler beeinflusse, k\u00f6nne das den Unterschied ausmachen. Erfahrungen aus anderen L\u00e4ndern wiesen darauf hin.\n\nParallelen zur Frankreich-Wahl 2017\n\nPolitikwissenschaftler Edelson erinnert an 2017, als Emmanuel Macron in Frankreich das Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen gegen die Rechtspopulistin Marine LePen gewann. Edelson sieht Parallelen zu der momentanen Situation in den USA. In normalen Zeiten unterst\u00fctzten Republikaner Republikaner und Demokraten Demokraten. Die Situation jetzt sei ein Signal, das den W\u00e4hlern sage, dass etwas sehr Ungew\u00f6hnliches passiere.\n\n\"Es ist wie in Frankreich im Jahr 2017, als Konservative Macron und seine Partei gegen Le Pen unterst\u00fctzt haben. Es gibt Anzeichen daf\u00fcr, dass dies einen Effekt hatte\", so Edelson. Wie gro\u00df der Effekt am Ende tats\u00e4chlich sein wird, sei nicht vorherzusehen. Aber, wenn er Trump w\u00e4re, sagt der Politikwissenschaftler, w\u00fcrde er sich Sorgen machen."

It turns out they are distant cousins.\n\nThe photo shows eight smiling people wearing navy pro-Trump shirts, underneath a \"Trump 2024 \u2014 Take America Back\u201d sign. The photo was eventually reposted by former President Donald Trump, who wrote on his Truth Social platform: \u201cIt is a Great Honor to have your Endorsement. I look forward to meeting you soon!\u201d\n\nThe photo was first posted on X by Charles Herbster, a former candidate for governor in Nebraska who had Trump\u2019s endorsement in the 2022 campaign. Herbster\u2019s spokesperson, Rod Edwards, said the people in the photo are cousins to the Minnesota governor, who is now Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate.\n\n\u201cThe family in the picture are the descendants of Francis Walz, who was brother to Tim Walz\u2019s grandfather,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey\u2019re all Walzes and spouses.\u201d\n\nThe descendants of Francis Walz confirmed their relationship to Tim Walz in a text message to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cShortly after Governor Tim Walz was named the Democrat Party Vice Presidential nominee, our family had a get-together. We had t-shirts made to show support for President Trump and J.D. Vance and took a group picture. That photo was shared with friends, and when we were asked for permission to post the picture, we agreed,\u201d the written statement said.\n\n\u201cThe picture is real. The shirts are real. We are the Nebraska Walz family and we are related to Gov. Tim Walz, our grandfathers were brothers. The message on the shirts speaks for itself, \u201cNebraska Walzs for Trump.\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s sister, Sandy Dietrich, of Alliance, Nebraska, said she suspected it might be people from that branch of the family. Dietrich and Walz\u2019s father, James Walz, died of lung cancer in 1984 when the future congressman and Minnesota governor was just a teenager. His father had been the school superintendent in Valentine, Nebraska.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t close with them. We didn\u2019t know them,\u201d she said.\n\nDietrich declined to comment on their distant cousins\u2019 opposition to her brother and referred to herself and her family as \u201cDemocrats for Tim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who I\u2019m voting for. That\u2019s all I can control,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Tim Walz\u2019s other surviving sibling is not behind his candidacy.\n\nIn recent days, the New York Post has reported on Facebook comments from the governor\u2019s older brother, Jeff Walz of Freeport, Florida, in which he said of his younger sibling: \u201cThe stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.\u201d The 67-year-old also wrote that he was \u201c100% opposed to all his ideology\u201d and had thought about endorsing Trump, the Post reported.\n\nIn comments published Wednesday by NewsNation, Jeff Walz said that he was still irked he learned on the radio that his brother would be Harris\u2019 running mate, but that he didn\u2019t intend to influence the political debate and doesn\u2019t want to be involved with anybody\u2019s campaign.\n\nJeff Walz told NewsNation that he and the 60-year-old governor have not spoken since the funeral of their younger brother, Craig Walz, in 2016, aside from a brief phone call last month through their mother. He told NewsNation that what he was referring to in his post by \u201cstories\u201d were from their childhood.\n\n\u201cNobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us, that sort of thing,\u201d Jeff Walz said. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else. There\u2019s other stories like that, but I think that probably gives you the gist of it.\u201d\n\nHe also told NewsNation that he would make no further statements on the subject. He did not immediately return messages left Wednesday by the AP.\n\n\u2014Associated Press writers Randy Herschaft and Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report."

Lichtman explained that even if these two keys flipped to Trump, he would still not be predicted to win as that would add up to five false answers.\n\nThe historian believes that one of the reasons Harris is likely to win in 2023, is the Democratic Party's move to throw their support behind her and avoid a Primary after Joe Biden dropped out.\n\n\"The Democrats finally got smart and united overwhelmingly behind Vice President Harris,\" he told the Times.\n\nTrump reveals reason he agreed to strict Kamala Harris debate rules as ABC showdown to include muted mics & no audience\n\nThis meant Lichtman the key statement, \"There is no primary contest for the incumbent party nomination,\" is true.\n\nOther true keys have included no third party challenger, a strong short term economy, major policy changes, and stronger long-term economic growth in the last two terms of Biden's tenure.\n\nIn fact, Lichtman's only confident false answers were for the midterm gains key, as the Democrats lost House seats, the incumbency key, as Biden is not running for re-election, and the incumbent charisma key.\n\nLichtman noted two keys that could swing either way.\n\nThe other keys that swung in Harris's favor were no major social unrest and no White House scandal.\n\nThe 13 Keys to the White House HISTORIAN Allan Lichtman predicts the winner of presidential elections by using his algorithm that consists of 13 true or false statements.

We\u2019ve got to bolster security so if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children they\u2019re not able.\u201d\n\nVance said he doesn't like the idea of his own kids going to a school with hardened security, \u201cbut that's increasingly the reality that we live in.\u201d\n\nHe called the shooting in Georgia an \u201cawful tragedy,\" and said the families in Winder, Georgia, need prayers and sympathy.\n\nEarlier this year, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, toured the bloodstained Florida classroom building where the 2018 Parkland high school massacre happened. She then announced a program to assist states that have laws allowing police to temporarily seize guns from people judges have found to be dangerous.\n\nHarris, who leads the new White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, has supported both stronger gun controls, such as banning sales of AR-15 and similar rifles, and better school security, like making sure classroom doors don't lock from the outside as they did in Parkland."

            "text": "Former President Donald Trump, a father of five, was asked on Thursday what he would do to lower the cost of child care should he win in November \u2014 and his answer was baffling.\n\nFollowing a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump was asked what specific legislation he would pursue to help lower the cost of child care for working parents. His response was a lengthy, utterly incoherent word salad that seemed to suggest widespread tariffs would solve the problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important issue. But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I\u2019m talking about, that, because, look, child care is child care. It\u2019s something you know you have to have it, in this country you have to have it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe former president then rambled about taxes on foreign countries. \u201cBut when you talk about those numbers compared to the type of numbers I\u2019m talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they\u2019re not used to, but they\u2019ll get used to it very quickly,\u201d he added.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s answer on how he will make childcare more affordable: pic.twitter.com/Hwu7R5aIt6 \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) September 5, 2024\n\nBoth the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign mocked the response from Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you have any idea what the hell that answer means, you\u2019re a better detective than I am, because these tariffs that he wants to apply across the board would amount to a $4,000 tax increase on working families,\u201d White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told MSNBC on Friday.\n\nThe Harris campaign tweeted a clip of the moment from their official X account.\n\nRising costs of child care and child rearing have become a flagship issue for the Harris campaign. The vice president has promised the return of the expanded child tax credit, and a $6,000 tax credit for the parents of newborn children.\n\nBy contrast, the Republican ticket has struggled to produce an answer on child rearing and reproduction that doesn\u2019t sound like it was ripped from a Men\u2019s Rights Activism forum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance was asked how he would lower the cost of childcare during a Turning Point USA event. He suggested getting family to help, as if struggling Americans haven\u2019t already been doing this to the extent that they are able.

So one of the ways that you might be able to relieve a little bit of pressure on people who are paying so much for day care is \u2026 maybe grandma and grandpa [want] to help out a little bit more, or maybe there\u2019s an aunt or uncle that wants to help out a little bit more. If that happens, you relieve some of the pressure on all the resources that we\u2019re spending on day care,\u201d Vance responded.\n\nKirk: What can we do about lowering the cost of daycare? pic.twitter.com/YIS68cXKw4 \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) September 5, 2024\n\nThe response echoed past remarks from Vance where he agreed that the \u201cwhole purpose\u201d of post-menopausal women is to help other women raise their children."

Authorities received several anonymous tips in May 2023 about online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time. Those threats contained images of guns. The FBI says it identified and interviewed the then-13-year-old suspect and his father. The father said they had hunting guns but the teen didn\u2019t have unsupervised access to them. The boy denied making the online threats. The sheriff\u2019s office alerted local schools to monitor him, but there was no probable cause for arrest or additional law enforcement action at the time.

The staffers named in the indictment are Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 The goal seems to be amplifying topics like immigration, inflation and undermining support for Ukraine without indication that RT was behind the videos, NPR\u2019s Shannon Bond says. The indictment says the employees funneled nearly $10 million to a Tennessee company to make the alleged scheme work. The company was not named, but details match one called Tenet Media.

He is the author of the 2018 book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood , an exploration of border conflicts, unrecognized countries, and changes to the world map.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Vice President Kamala Harris shake hands at the end of a press conference at the Munich Security Conference on February 17, 2024. Tobias Schwarz/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIs Vice President Kamala Harris a \u201chuman rights hawk,\u201d who would use American power to promote democracy and freedom abroad? Or is she a \u201cpragmatic internationalist\u201d who would back gingerly away from American hegemony?\n\n\n\nIs she poised to end an era of American hubris and restore humility to our foreign policy? Or does her forceful rhetoric on America\u2019s role in the world reveal an \u201cinner Reagan\u201d?\n\nTwo months out from the presidential election, there\u2019s rampant speculation about what a \u201cHarris doctrine\u201d for foreign policy could look like, but it often seems to reveal more about what the person doing the speculating wants (or doesn\u2019t want) in the next president than any particular worldview articulated by Harris.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the vice president doesn\u2019t have a track record to examine. While some coverage has portrayed her as something of a foreign-policy neophyte, she would come into office with more global experience than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, or Donald Trump had.\n\nAs vice president, she has met with dozens of world leaders, represented the US at global gatherings, and attended the president\u2019s daily intelligence briefings. In her Democratic National Convention address, she touted the fact that she had been the one to brief Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on US intelligence about the looming Russian invasion in Munich just days before it occurred in 2022.\n\nThe administration has also noted her role in the recent prisoner swap with Russia. She also was involved in US efforts to strengthen alliances in Southeast Asia, particularly with the Philippines. And though she was not the \u201cborder czar\u201d she\u2019s sometimes portrayed as in attack ads, she did lead the administration\u2019s efforts to address the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration through aid to Central America.\n\nWhat\u2019s harder to pin down is how she might differ from the Biden administration, which is what all the \u201cHarris doctrine\u201d speculation is trying to pin down. When it comes to that, the analysis often comes down to \u2014 to use the buzzword of the moment \u2014 vibes.\n\nSame message, new tone\n\nIn a recent Time feature on Harris\u2019s record on Ukraine, Ukrainian officials acknowledged she had been engaged on the issue and showed sympathy for the country\u2019s plight, but one official described it as feeling like \u201cformal sympathy, following protocol.\u201d\n\nIn a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show podcast, the host speculated that as the child of immigrants with a more global perspective, Harris \u201cdoes not have that identification\u201d with Israel that Americans of Joe Biden\u2019s generation do. But that\u2019s not quite how Harris has described her own upbringing. In a 2017 speech to the right-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) she reminisced that as a child in the Bay Area, she collected donations for the Jewish National Fund to plant trees in Israel. In 2019, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency described her Senate record as \u201cmore AIPAC than J Street,\u201d referring to the more left-leaning \u201cpro peace\u201d lobbying group.\n\nWhen it comes to how Harris might differ, even subtly, from Biden, perhaps no issue, foreign or domestic, has gotten more attention than the war in Gaza.\n\nHalie Soifer, who worked as national security adviser to Harris in the Senate and is now the director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told Vox that when it comes to policy on Israel and Gaza, there is little daylight between the two.\n\n\u201cI think the policy will not change,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we have seen is some distinction when it comes to the way they speak about the conflict, with Vice President Harris not only reiterating her commitment to Israel and its security, but also expressing a larger degree of empathy with innocent Palestinian civilians.\u201d\n\nThis was reflected in pointed remarks Harris made calling for a ceasefire at a civil rights commemoration in Selma, Alabama, in March (remarks that were reportedly watered down by administration officials) as well as in her convention speech. As my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote, that speech did not differ particularly from Biden\u2019s talking points but did, rhetorically at least, present \u201cPalestinian aspirations for self-determination as the moral climax of her discussion of the issue.\u201d\n\nSlate\u2019s Fred Kaplan reports that sources close to Harris say she \u201cprivately disagrees with [Biden\u2019s] formulation of world politics as a contest between democracy and autocracy \u2026 and sees that as oversimplifying and even misleading, given the kinds of allies that we\u2019re sometimes forced to choose.\u201d The Biden administration has been criticized by some observers for paying attention to the \u201cglobal south\u201d mainly in the context of competition with Russia and China.\n\nPerhaps reflecting some desire to move beyond this framing, Harris remarked at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that when visiting countries in Africa, she was constantly asked, \u201c\u2018Are you here because of China?\u2019 And my answer was, \u2018No, we are here because of the people on the continent of Africa.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhy campaign promises can\u2019t tell us much about Harris\u2019s real policies\n\nIt\u2019s also quite possible that Harris\u2019s worldview and foreign policy rhetoric are simply evolving. The senator who, in 2020, said, \u201cI unequivocally agree with the goal of reducing the defense budget and redirecting funding to communities in need\u201d is now the vice president who vows to \u201censure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.\u201d\n\nUltimately, campaign rhetoric will only tell you so much about how a president will conduct foreign policy. Some analysts have noted that, as a senator, Harris was in favor of cutting support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, and called for \u201cfundamentally reevaluating\u201d the US-Saudi relationship as a candidate in 2020. But then again, Biden promised on the campaign trail to make Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman a \u201cpariah\u201d before putting cooperation with the country at the center of his Middle East policy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that campaign talk is cheap, it\u2019s that, as the noted international relations theorist Mike Tyson put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\n\nGeorge W. Bush came into office promising a \u201chumble\u201d foreign policy that eschewed nation-building crusades. 9/11 changed that.\n\nObama first distinguished himself as an opponent of US militarism in the Middle East but will be remembered for expanding the US drone war, the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, and helping to overthrow the government of Libya.\n\nBiden\u2019s foreign policy legacy will be determined in large part by his response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the October 7 attacks.\n\n\u201cForeign policy priorities, in every administration, are largely dictated by events,\u201d Soifer said.\n\nIf there is a \u201cHarris doctrine,\u201d we\u2019ll learn what it is only if we see her as president."

            "text": "ANALYSIS \u2014 Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris described each other as a threat to voters\u2019 wallets and constitutional rights during their first campaign stops since Labor Day.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, opted for the bigger splash, taping a town hall in swing-state Pennsylvania that aired in prime time on Fox News. (Though billed as a town hall, only the host asked questions, not voters seated in the New Holland Arena, which was lined with sections of empty seats.)\n\nHarris made a campaign stop in New Hampshire, a state the Democratic nominee has won every cycle since 2004.\n\nThe nominees were back on the campaign trail as new polling further solidified both camps\u2019 assessments that the race likely will be extremely close in November.\n\nCNN-SSRS polling released Wednesday morning showed that neither Trump nor Harris has a clear path to the White House, with both candidates running close in the battleground states that likely will decide the election.\n\nHarris led in both Georgia and Nevada by a single point, 48 percent to 47 percent. They were tied in Pennsylvania. Harris had larger leads in Wisconsin (6 percentage points) and Michigan (5 points). Trump led 49 percent to 44 percent in Arizona, according to the polling, which had a 4.9 percent margin of error.\n\nHere are four takeaways from their campaign stops, with 60 days to go until Election Day.\n\n\u2018We have a little lead\u2019\n\nDespite the CNN polling released earlier Wednesday, Trump continued to dismiss polls that suggest the race has swung since President Joe Biden ended his bid for another term.\n\n\u201cI hear the polls are close, and we have a little lead. I just find it hard to believe. First of all, they\u2019ve been so bad,\u201d Trump told Fox commentator and host Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done such a bad job. But that\u2019s why the enthusiasm is so bad,\u201d Trump said, falsely suggesting that there has been no surge in excitement among Democratic voters since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.\n\nBut when Republican-leaning polling firms like Rasmussen release surveys putting him comfortably ahead nationally, Trump pushes them hard on social media. What\u2019s more, the former president appeared to miss an opportunity to appeal directly to grieving voters in what Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales calls a toss-up state after a 14-year-old student killed four people Wednesday at a high school in Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe had this shooting today in Georgia,\u201d Hannity noted at the start of the program. Trump replied, \u201cRight.\u201d And when Hannity said Americans were sending prayers to the families and victims, Trump said nothing. Georgia is among the key swing states that analysts expect will decide the election.\n\n\u2018How nice our criminals are\u2019\n\nAmid calls from some Republican lawmakers for Trump to stick to several policy issues \u2014 chiefly illegal immigration and the Biden economic record \u2014 the former president got one of his biggest applause lines on the former.\n\n\u201cWe have to do the largest deportation in \u2026 history,\u201d Trump told Hannity, with the Fox commentator calling those who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally \u201cunvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants.\u201d The crowd in Harrisburg, Pa., roared.\n\nTrump continued to call Harris \u201cthe border czar, whether you like it or not\u201d \u2014 a title White House officials have said Biden never gave his No. 2; they contend he put her in charge of diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of illegal border crossings.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to use that term, she was in charge of the border. It\u2019s the worst border in the history of the world,\u201d Trump said, ignoring federal law enforcement agencies\u2019 data that White House and Harris campaign officials have pointed to for weeks showing that border crossings have been declining. In fact, in late June, administration officials said illegal crossings were down 40 percent since Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nHannity did not ask Trump about Harris\u2019 sharp criticism of the effort he spearheaded that led to Republican senators tanking an immigration and border package that one of the most conservative Republicans, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, had negotiated with Democrats and the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions to sink that deal have become Harris\u2019 go-to retort when Trump and other Republicans slam her with the \u201cborder czar\u201d line.\n\nTrump, who is a convicted felon awaiting sentencing in a New York business fraud case, falsely described the United States as being overrun by illegal migrants who were murderers, drug dealers and \u201cwoman traffickers\u201d back home. Then came one of the night\u2019s oddest lines, especially from Trump, who has said negative things about those convicted of violent crimes in major cities with Democratic local and state officials.\n\n\u201cOur criminals are nice people by comparison,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re showing how nice our criminals are.\u201d\n\n\u2018Opportunity economy\u2019\n\nHarris used her campaign event in North Hampton, N.H., to announce her latest economic proposal amid Republican criticism \u2014 including from Trump \u2014 that she had both been complicit in what they call poorly crafted policy under Biden and her lack of a plan of her own.\n\nThe Democratic nominee laid out a proposal to expand the small-business tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000, part of what she described as \u201cbuilding an opportunity economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe America\u2019s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy. Think about it \u2026 small businesses in our country employ half of all private-sector employees,\u201d she said. \u201cThey generate revenue that helps pave our roads and pay our teachers.\u201d\n\nIn a clip-and-save moment, she also set a goal of 25 million small-business applications during her four-year term, if elected in November. Harris described her plan as \u201cessentially a tax cut for starting a small business.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s campaign touted analyses from financial firm Goldman Sachs that estimated, should Democrats sweep both chambers of Congress and the White House, job growth would be 10,000 better per month than if Trump won with a divided Congress \u2014 and 30,000 higher per month under a GOP sweep.\n\nBut the Trump campaign described her announcement as a \u201csham small business \u2018plan.\u2019\u201d In a statement, his campaign contended that \u201cKamala\u2019s $20 billion plan is just another cog in the wheel of her multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending scheme that would add trillions to the debt and drive costs up even higher.\u201d\n\nHarris is attempting to pivot to the middle, while Trump\u2019s campaign wants to paint her as a progressive pretending to be a populist.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t trust women\u2019\n\nHarris\u2019 stop in the Granite State was not all about her small-business proposals \u2014 she also again went right after Trump.\n\nA rally-goer appeared to yell out, \u201cLock him up,\u201d referring to the once-convicted and twice-impeached Trump\u2019s legal cases. Harris did not venture into the legal realm, however.\n\n\u201cThe courts are going to handle that, and we will handle November,\u201d she fired back, to loud applause. \u201cHow about that?\u201d Later, she accused Trump of aiming to \u201cterminate the Constitution.\u201d\n\nShe accused the former president of \u201cgaslighting\u201d voters on the end of federal abortion rights, noting that he had appointed three of the Supreme Court\u2019s six right-leaning justices who voted to do so.\n\nShe alleged that Trump would, if elected, create a \u201cnational anti-abortion coordinator, which would force states \u2026 to report on women\u2019s miscarriages and abortions,\u201d she said, adding of Republicans: \u201cThey don\u2019t trust women.\u201d\n\n\u201cOurs is a fight for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it is a fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nTrump often refers to \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d Democrats. Harris wants to flip that charge on him."

            "text": "For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow would back US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, in presidential elections in November.\n\nThe nature of Putin\u2019s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.\n\nYet whatever Putin\u2019s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader\u2019s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.\n\nThis is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate. Putin himself has been in Russia\u2019s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.\n\nAl Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president\u2019s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.\n\nDid Putin endorse Harris?\n\nAt an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his \u201cfavourite\u201d.\n\nSince Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin\u2019s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.\n\nHe added that Harris has an \u201cexpressive and infectious laugh\u201d, which indicates \u201cshe\u2019s doing well\u201d. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m insulted or he did me a favour,\u201d Republican challenger Trump responded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.\n\n2004: Putin endorses Bush\n\nIn October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the \u201cspread of terrorism\u201d globally.\n\nBush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nThis was amid the war on Iraq which started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.\n\nBush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.\n\n2008: Russia leans towards Obama win\n\nWhile Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain was Russia\u2019s preferred outcome.\n\nWhile both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.\n\nAfter being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.\n\nHence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in \u201ctandemocracy\u201d.\n\nObama won the 2008 election.\n\n2012: Putin praises Obama\n\nAhead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was \u201can honest person who really wants to change much for the better\u201d.\n\nRomney had deemed Russia the top \u201cgeopolitical foe\u201d of the US, something Putin said Romney was \u201cmistaken\u201d about, during the same interview.\n\nObama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.\n\n2015: Putin deems Trump \u2018outstanding and talented\u2019\n\nAhead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.\n\n\u201cHe is a bright and talented person without any doubt,\u201d he said, adding that Trump is \u201coutstanding and talented\u201d.\n\nTrump was up against Democratic challenger Hilary Clinton in the election.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election victory, Putin said Trump was a \u201cclever man\u201d who would \u201cquickly understand\u201d his role in office.\n\n2016: US blames Russia for DNC leaks, election interference\n\nIn July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails were hacked and leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nPutin denied Russia\u2019s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. \u201cThe important thing is the content that was given to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.\n\n2019: Putin jokes Russia will meddle in 2020 election\n\nIn October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret: Yes, we\u2019ll definitely do it. Just don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.\n\nHe then said his working relationship with Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.\n\n\u201cWe have our own problems,\u201d he said."

Lichtman said that it helped that she was facing off against Trump, who \"only appeals to a narrow base.\"\n\nHarris, he said, also didn't have a third-party challenger since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last two keys \u2014 on foreign policy failures and successes \u2014 wouldn't matter as much since Trump would still only have five keys even if they were against Harris, Lichtman said.\n\nLichtman's assessment marks a slight shift from his last prediction in July when he told The Wall Street Journal that the Democratic Party should stick with Biden if they wanted to retain the White House.\n\n\"Biden running checks off two keys right. Biden steps aside, they lose obviously the incumbency, and it's not at all clear that there wouldn't be a big party fight,\" he said then.\n\nAlthough Biden did eventually drop out, Harris was able to avert a primary contest. Besides securing Biden's endorsement, Harris was able to get her party to unite around her in short order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, Lichtman's predictions haven't always been on the money. He got the 2000 election wrong when he predicted a victory for Al Gore instead of the eventual winner, George W. Bush.\n\nThat's been the only election outcome Lichtman got wrong since he started giving predictions in the 1984 election.\n\nRepresentatives for the Harris campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours."

Read preview\n\nDozens of prominent Wall Street and tech executives combined forces on Friday morning to support Kamala Harris' bid for the White House. Eighty-eight top executives signed a joint letter endorsing the vice president, CNBC reported.\n\nThe signatories span political engagement, from longtime Democratic donors to people issuing their first public endorsement of Harris. James Murdoch, the former CEO of 21st Century Fox, broke even further away from his father by adding his name to the list.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThough the list of signatories is lengthy, the letter itself is a mere five sentences. Electing Harris is, the executives wrote, \"the best way to support the continued strength, security, and reliability of our democracy and economy.\" They celebrated her record support of small businesses and said she would \"continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment.\"\n\nCurrent executives include Aaron Levie of Box and Jeremy Stoppelman of Yelp, as well as big names in the sports world. The NBA Hall of Famer and billionaire Magic Johnson signed on, so did Ted Leonsis, whose company owns the NBA's Washington Wizards and WNBA's Washington Mystics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome signatories, such as Murdoch and the Ripple Labs cofounder Chris Larsen, declared their support for Harris for the first time.\n\n\"Proud to support the Harris campaign \u2014 she's the right leader for our fast-changing world,\" Larsen told Business Insider in a statement. \"And I'm confident that she will reset the misguided Biden policies that were too anti-business and anti-innovation. At the same time, I'm confident she will maintain Biden's strong leadership on our energy transition.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nLarsen added that he recently donated $1 million in crypto to Future Forward, a PAC supporting Harris.\n\nOther signatories have long rallied behind the vice president. Many know her from her days in California politics, which reflects how Harris is relying on her home state for support, financial and otherwise. The veteran Harris supporters include the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs and the Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth coasts are well represented, with executives from Silicon Valley and Wall Street alike joining the effort. The angel investor Ron Conway, the entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and the LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman are among the biggest West Coast names, while former Blackstone President and CEO Tony James and the former Goldman Sachs executive Bruce Heyman hail from the world of New York finance.\n\nFormer executives at various prominent companies \u2014 including PepsiCo, Paramount, Lyft, and Starbucks \u2014 also signed on to endorse Harris.\n\nThe support from the business community comes at a crucial time, as both Harris and Trump are laying out their economic agendas ahead of Tuesday's debate. Both candidates are presenting themselves as the pro-business option while attempting to woo the financial and tech sectors.\n\nCorrection: September 6, 2024 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misdescribed Harris. She is the current US vice president, not a former vice president."

I'm Leah Feiger, the senior politics editor at WIRED. A few months ago, a lot of people were concerned about how artificial intelligence might affect the 2024 US election. AI-generated images, audio, and video had just gotten so good and was so easy to make and spread. The WIRED politics team in our project tracking the use of AI in elections around the world actually called 2024 the year of the generative AI election. Lately, it seems like some of the panic around AI has subsided, but deepfakes of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and other politicians and their supporters are everywhere. And as we'll talk about today, legislation on political deepfakes, including AI-generated pornography, is really tricky. So with the election looming, what has changed, if anything, and how much should we really be worrying about AI? Joining me to talk about all of this are two of WIRED's AI experts. We have politics reporter Vittoria Elliott\u2014\n\nVittoria Elliott: Hi, Leah.\n\nLeah Feiger: Hey, Tori. And from Cambridge, Massachusetts, senior writer Will Knight. Will, thank you so much for coming on. It's your first time here.\n\nWill Knight: Yep. Hello. Thank you for having me.\n\nLeah Feiger: So let's start with porn, if that's OK. Tori, you have a big article out today all about US states tackling the issue of AI-generated porn. Tell us about it. How are people handling this?\n\nVittoria Elliott: It's actually really piecemeal, and that's because on a fundamental level, we don't have national regulation on this. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was herself the target of nonconsensual deepfake porn this year, has introduced the Defiance Act, which would allow victims to sue the people who create and share nonconsensual deepfake porn as long as they can show that the images or videos were made nonconsensually. And then Senator Ted Cruz also has a bill called the Take It Down Act that would let people force platforms to remove those images and videos. But there hasn't really been major movement on these in several months, and this issue has gotten a lot of attention, particularly because we've seen the spate of young people, of middle and high schoolers, using generative AI technology to bully their peers, to make explicit images and videos of their peers. And we obviously have data that shows that while generative AI is maybe still being used in politics, and we definitely have a ton of examples where it is, mostly it's used to target and harass and intimidate women."

            "headline": "Don\u2019t Underestimate Kamala Harris\u2019 Good Vibes Only Campaign",
            "text": "Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential run against Donald Trump is nearing its final act. And while Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine democracy and leveled vicious personal attacks against her, throughout the campaign so far, the public seen never seen Harris get mad\u2014in fact, she\u2019s full of joy. Her campaign is playfully tapping into the latest social media trends and memes. And rather than complaining and insulting people like Donald Trump, she\u2019s laughing and smiling on the campaign trail. \u201cThe thing we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work,\u201d she told autoworkers in Michigan.\n\nPundits have largely interpreted this as a classic expression of Black joy\u2014a form of incredible resilience in the face of the ugly challenges Black people have long faced in the U.S.\u2014or complained that joy can\u2019t substitute for smart policies (true).\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign has never suggested joy is a policy. It\u2019s a political strategy, and we\u2019re radically underestimating just how smart it is. Adopting a joyful approach has simultaneously highlighted Trump\u2019s biggest weaknesses (his age and cantankerousness), taken the spotlight off him and possibly endeared Harris to the majority of Americans who\u2019ve had enough of our country\u2019s uncivilized politics. It has also deprived Trump of the easiest line of attack he\u2019d otherwise have against Harris\u2014the same attack that Trump had against democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016: the contention that she\u2019s crazy. Expressing rage would allow him to portray Harris as such.\n\n\u201cWhen a man becomes angry in an argument or debate, people are more likely to abandon their own positions and defer to his,\u201d Soraya Chemaly writes in Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women\u2019s Anger. \u201cBut when a woman acts the same way, she\u2019s likely to elicit the opposite response.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just that people wouldn\u2019t believe Harris if she appeared angry. Women candidates often have to walk a tightrope to appear presidential without displaying characteristics that the public accepts without question from men in the public eye. \u201cMale candidates are allowed to yell, to be \u2018passionate\u2019 and volatile. It\u2019s a mark of their dedication,\u201d Gemma Hartley writes in FED UP: Emotional Labor, Women, and the Way Forward.\u201d But, for a woman, \u201ctipping anywhere near yelling means being labeled \u2018shrill,\u2019 and America has a serious problem with shrill women. Assertiveness turns from a leadership trait to a sign of instability when it is a woman on stage.\u201d\n\nAs a Black woman, Harris is especially vulnerable. From early childhood, the behavior of Black women in the U.S. has historically been carefully policed for any perceived expression of dissatisfaction. For example, Black girls are 5.5 times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. And when Black women do try to share their concerns, they\u2019re often simply ignored or written off as \u201ctoo difficult.\u201d\n\nBut eschewing anger isn\u2019t just protecting Harris from political risks. It\u2019s highlighting one of her biggest strengths: the enthusiasm with which her campaign has quickly been met.\n\nRead More: The Reintroduction of Kamala Harris\n\nWhat\u2019s more, something feels fresh and youthful about the way Harris laughs and has fun on the campaign trail. Without lobbing a single insult, it paints a massive contrast with Trump\u2019s two biggest weaknesses: he\u2019s an angry septuagenarian.\n\nThe majority of people in the U.S. \u2013 62%, to be exact\u2013 think Trump is too old to be president, according to a February ABC News/IPSOS poll. We\u2019re also tired of our country\u2019s ugly politics \u2013 literally. Some 65% of Americans always or often feel exhausted when we think about politics, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nHarris\u2019 refusal to rebut Trump\u2019s mean insults and inaccurate claims \u2013 most famously, when she was asked in a CNN interview about Trump\u2019s contention that she isn\u2019t Black and responded that he was using the \u201csame old tired playbook\u201d before asking for the next question\u2014is likely to appeal to voters who want more civility in our politics.\n\nThis approach is also undermining one of Trump\u2019s main strategies on the campaign trail and as president: picking arguments with people. \u201cIt has long been clear that no spectacle is more absorbing than a fight,\u201d Tim Wu wrote in The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside our Heads, which is why one of Trump\u2019s signature strategies has been \u201ccontinuous warfare.\u201d\n\nBy not responding to his attacks, Harris isn\u2019t participating in the spectacle. That\u2019s had the effect of taking a lot of media attention off Trump\u2014one of the most devastating things she could do to him personally and politically. Recall that the continuous coverage the media gave Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign\u2014largely because his unorthodox tactics made for good entertainment\u2014is one of the major things that helped him win that election. But this year, Harris is getting plenty of media attention of her own.\n\nOf course, joy isn\u2019t why voters should cast their ballots for Harris\u2014they should be examining her policies, which she\u2019s continuing to roll out on the trail and which are already having an impact on voters. (For example, low income voters now significantly favor Harris over Trump \u2013 a huge change from June, when they favored Biden by a mere 3 percentage points, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released this week.) But this campaign tactic is making Harris a more formidable political candidate\u2014and signaling to voters that she\u2019ll go about getting things done in new, strategic ways."

            "text": "Democrats launch text message campaign in Florida Senate race to reach Latino voters\n\ntoggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nDebbie Mucarsel-Powell, the former U.S. House Democrat now challenging Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott for the Senate, has launched a new campaign on WhatsApp to reach voters and attack a sea of disinformation.\n\nThe direct messaging operation is part of a broader attempt to close the gap in a race that has grown increasingly tight. Democrats face an uphill battle undoing Republican gains in the state in recent years, particularly in an election where former President Trump is expected to add to GOP turnout in the state. However, Democrats think they can move the needle, particularly with Latino voters, through smartphones.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's particularly created to target Latino voters across the state to provide them with accurate, factual information coming straight from the source,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell, the sole Latina candidate running for U.S. Senate this year, told NPR.\n\nThe Scott campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe messaging campaign includes two channels on the messaging platform WhatsApp \u2014 one in English and another in Spanish.\n\nThe effort also coincides with a similar launch by the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, which now has its own bilingual channel to reach Latino voters. In their case, the Harris campaign said it was a first-of-its kind in a presidential contest.\n\nThe encrypted platform is a free messaging app that is particularly popular among immigrants, and especially Latinos, to communicate through texts and calls domestically and internationally. With campaigns increasingly looking to use the app, they hope their network will grow with voters as updates are shared by users.\n\nMucarsel-Powell argues WhatsApp will let her directly reach Florida\u2019s Hispanic community, often a target of disinformation. A Pew Research report found 46% of Hispanic Americans use the messaging program compared to a quarter of Americans. It\u2019s used by 23% of Black Americans and 16% of white Americans, the group found.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's very easy to forward, and it's actually one of the reasons why there's been so much disinformation, because of that easy feature, the easy forwarding feature,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell said. \u201cAnd so we wanted to have our own channels to allow our own supporters to just forward the contact to their networks across the state.\u201d\n\nMucarsel-Powell is Democrats\u2019 first Spanish-speaking candidate for U.S. Senate in Florida. And the WhatsApp effort is part of an overall campaign strategy to reach Latino voters who sat out previous elections, which includes dozens of English and Spanish language campaign events so far as well as ads in both languages.\n\nBOLD PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, has identified the Florida Senate race as a top target to address disinformation and reach Latino voters. In the last presidential election in 2020, Mucarsel-Powell and others raised alarm with congressional members over misinformation on WhatsApp and Facebook that was reaching voters.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that Republicans have helped spread misinformation through their campaigns, while Republicans have argued the opposite.\n\nMucarsel-Powell\u2019s campaign faces a tough challenge trying to unseat Scott, the first-term senator now seeking re-election after previously serving as Florida governor.\n\nNow the home state Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump, Florida has largely turned red in recent years. However, Democrats argue their voters have been energized by the Harris presidential campaign and national issues, such as abortion access, which will be on Florida's November ballot."

            "headline": "Trump plans New York press conference after hearing appeal arguments in sexual abuse case",
            "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Shortly after appearing in court for an appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, Donald Trump stepped in front of television cameras Friday and brought up a string of past allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct, potentially reminding voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten.\n\nThe former president has made hitting back at opponents and accusers a centerpiece of his political identity, but his performance at his namesake Manhattan office tower was startling even by Trump's combative standards.\n\nAt times, he seemed to relish using graphic language and characterizations of the case brought by advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, which could expose the former president to further legal challenges from Carroll's attorneys. His remarks were especially striking given that they came four days before Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris, with early voting about to begin in some parts of the country and Election Day just two months away.\n\nTrump is doing his best to stay in the public eye while Harris prepares for the debate in private, meeting with her advisers in Pittsburgh. That\u2019s a reflection of their divergent campaign styles, with Trump frequently engaging with reporters \u2014 albeit often in friendly settings \u2014 while Harris has done just one interview and no news conferences since taking President Joe Biden\u2019s place atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nHis team had billed Friday's appearance as a press conference and Trump repeatedly brought up Harris\u2019 lack of news conferences. But Trump took no questions and instead talked about the cases against him for an hour while hardly mentioning any campaign issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president, and I have all these cases all of a sudden come,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re fake cases.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign raised tens of millions of dollars off his previous indictments, convictions and appearances in court. But it\u2019s unclear how focusing on his legal woes will help him now as he works to win over undecided voters \u2014 including independents and those on the fence in critical swing states, ahead of a critical debate on Tuesday that will likely draw tens of millions of viewers.\n\nTrump has disregarded his aides' advice to focus on policy\n\nTrump's trying to seize the political offensive by bringing up allegations against him recalled 2016 when, in the weeks before Election Day, he attempted to dismiss as simple \u201clocker room talk\u201d a recording of him bragging about grabbing, forcibly kissing and sexually assaulting women, which triggered subsequent allegations of misconduct by a string of women.\n\nBut on Friday, standing inside Trump Tower, where he lived for decades before moving to Florida, Trump had many moments that evoked a more distant past.\n\nHe suggested women have accused him of wrongdoing because he is famous. He made a trio of references to how he was already famous in some circles in the 1970s, and talked about his work in the real estate and construction worlds in the 1980s \u2014 before millions of today's voters were born. At one point, he referenced the New York Post's famous \u201cPage Six\u201d gossip section, whose writers have spent decades covering him, as being the internet of its day.\n\nTrump called Carroll's case against him \u201cMonica Lewinsky Part II,\u201d referencing the then-White House intern who had a sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton, and recalled an infamous dress that played a pivotal role in the late-1990s impeachment proceedings against Clinton.\n\nThe former president also repeatedly implied he would not have assaulted two of his accusers due to their looks. He said of a woman who has accused him of sexual misconduct on a plane in the 1970s \u201cshe would not have been the chosen one,\u201d and of Carroll, \u201cI never touched her. I would have had no interest in meeting her in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nHarris, a former California attorney general, says frequently of her opponent's criminal record, \u201cI know Donald Trump's type.\u201d She had no public schedule as she continued debate preparation on Friday, but has built her campaign partly around the idea of prosecuting the case against him \u2014 and the accusations Trump brought up Friday could give her more lines of political attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters and aides have urged him to focus on policy contrasts with Harris instead of personal attacks during the final stretch of a race that remains extremely close.\n\nBut, as Trump spoke, two of his top political advisers were on a call with Republican members of Congress, criticizing the media as being too soft on Harris while saying they felt confident about the race for the White House. Instead, the former president was flanked by his lawyers, some of whom also spoke in defense of their client.\n\nTrump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major candidate\n\nHis comments came after Trump was in court to hear his lawyers argue for overturning a jury's $5 million verdict finding him liable of sexually abusing Carroll in 1996.\n\nJuries now have twice now awarded Carroll huge sums for Trump's claiming she made up a story about him attacking her in a department store dressing room to help her sell a memoir. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from continuing to make nearly identical statements to reporters. On Friday, he said again that Carroll was telling a \u201cmade up, fabricated story.\u201d\n\nCarroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, warned in March after a jury awarded Carroll another $83 million that she would continue to monitor Trump\u2019s comments and would consider suing again if he kept it up. In a speedy response to his Friday comments at Trump Tower, Kaplan said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say it again: All options are on the table.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Trump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major-party nominee.\n\nHe has separately been convicted on 34 felony counts in a New York state case related to hush money payments allegedly made to a porn actor. The judge in that case announced separately Friday that he would postpone sentencing until after Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nTrump has also been ordered to pay steep civil fines for lying about his wealth for years.\n\nAnd he\u2019s still contending with cases alleging his mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 though none are likely to go to trial prior to Election Day."

            "text": "Former President Donald Trump, a father of five, was asked on Thursday what he would do to lower the cost of child care should he win in November \u2014 and his answer was baffling.\n\nFollowing a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump was asked what specific legislation he would pursue to help lower the cost of child care for working parents. His response was a lengthy, utterly incoherent word salad that seemed to suggest widespread tariffs would solve the problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important issue. But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I\u2019m talking about, that, because, look, child care is child care. It\u2019s something you know you have to have it, in this country you have to have it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe former president then rambled about taxes on foreign countries. \u201cBut when you talk about those numbers compared to the type of numbers I\u2019m talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they\u2019re not used to, but they\u2019ll get used to it very quickly,\u201d he added.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s answer on how he will make childcare more affordable: pic.twitter.com/Hwu7R5aIt6 \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) September 5, 2024\n\nBoth the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign mocked the response from Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you have any idea what the hell that answer means, you\u2019re a better detective than I am, because these tariffs that he wants to apply across the board would amount to a $4,000 tax increase on working families,\u201d White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told MSNBC on Friday.\n\nThe Harris campaign tweeted a clip of the moment from their official X account.\n\nRising costs of child care and child rearing have become a flagship issue for the Harris campaign. The vice president has promised the return of the expanded child tax credit, and a $6,000 tax credit for the parents of newborn children.\n\nBy contrast, the Republican ticket has struggled to produce an answer on child rearing and reproduction that doesn\u2019t sound like it was ripped from a Men\u2019s Rights Activism forum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance was asked how he would lower the cost of childcare during a Turning Point USA event. He suggested getting family to help, as if struggling Americans haven\u2019t already been doing this to the extent that they are able.

So one of the ways that you might be able to relieve a little bit of pressure on people who are paying so much for day care is \u2026 maybe grandma and grandpa [want] to help out a little bit more, or maybe there\u2019s an aunt or uncle that wants to help out a little bit more. If that happens, you relieve some of the pressure on all the resources that we\u2019re spending on day care,\u201d Vance responded.\n\nKirk: What can we do about lowering the cost of daycare? pic.twitter.com/YIS68cXKw4 \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) September 5, 2024\n\nThe response echoed past remarks from Vance where he agreed that the \u201cwhole purpose\u201d of post-menopausal women is to help other women raise their children."

Were you surprised?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that stuff, you know, it\u2019s a distraction,\u201d Emhoff replied. \u201cWe can joke about it, but it\u2019s literally a distraction, so all the insults, all the things coming at her, coming at me, coming at our family, it\u2019s really a distraction from what they are trying to do.\u201d\n\nEmhoff told Kimmel that Harris\u2019 presidential campaign has completely changed their lives. \u201cIt\u2019s like being shot out of a cannon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat day when she got the call and I of course was stuck here in LA and didn\u2019t hear about it for 30 or 40 minutes, since that moment it\u2019s just been hustle, hustle, hustle.\u201d He added that there\u2019s \u201calmost no happy couple time anymore\u201d because Harris is focused on winning the election.\n\nElsewhere in the 15-minute interview, Emhoff talked about growing up in Los Angeles, working at McDonald\u2019s in high school, and what it\u2019s been like being the country\u2019s first-ever Second Gentleman.

            "headline": "Trump, Harris begin post-Labor Day sprint...",
            "text": "ANALYSIS \u2014 Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris described each other as a threat to voters\u2019 wallets and constitutional rights during their first campaign stops since Labor Day.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, opted for the bigger splash, taping a town hall in swing-state Pennsylvania that aired in prime time on Fox News. (Though billed as a town hall, only the host asked questions, not voters seated in the New Holland Arena, which was lined with sections of empty seats.)\n\nHarris made a campaign stop in New Hampshire, a state the Democratic nominee has won every cycle since 2004.\n\nThe nominees were back on the campaign trail as new polling further solidified both camps\u2019 assessments that the race likely will be extremely close in November.\n\nCNN-SSRS polling released Wednesday morning showed that neither Trump nor Harris has a clear path to the White House, with both candidates running close in the battleground states that likely will decide the election.\n\nHarris led in both Georgia and Nevada by a single point, 48 percent to 47 percent. They were tied in Pennsylvania. Harris had larger leads in Wisconsin (6 percentage points) and Michigan (5 points). Trump led 49 percent to 44 percent in Arizona, according to the polling, which had a 4.9 percent margin of error.\n\nHere are four takeaways from their campaign stops, with 60 days to go until Election Day.\n\n\u2018We have a little lead\u2019\n\nDespite the CNN polling released earlier Wednesday, Trump continued to dismiss polls that suggest the race has swung since President Joe Biden ended his bid for another term.\n\n\u201cI hear the polls are close, and we have a little lead. I just find it hard to believe. First of all, they\u2019ve been so bad,\u201d Trump told Fox commentator and host Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done such a bad job. But that\u2019s why the enthusiasm is so bad,\u201d Trump said, falsely suggesting that there has been no surge in excitement among Democratic voters since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.\n\nBut when Republican-leaning polling firms like Rasmussen release surveys putting him comfortably ahead nationally, Trump pushes them hard on social media. What\u2019s more, the former president appeared to miss an opportunity to appeal directly to grieving voters in what Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales calls a toss-up state after a 14-year-old student killed four people Wednesday at a high school in Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe had this shooting today in Georgia,\u201d Hannity noted at the start of the program. Trump replied, \u201cRight.\u201d And when Hannity said Americans were sending prayers to the families and victims, Trump said nothing. Georgia is among the key swing states that analysts expect will decide the election.\n\n\u2018How nice our criminals are\u2019\n\nAmid calls from some Republican lawmakers for Trump to stick to several policy issues \u2014 chiefly illegal immigration and the Biden economic record \u2014 the former president got one of his biggest applause lines on the former.\n\n\u201cWe have to do the largest deportation in \u2026 history,\u201d Trump told Hannity, with the Fox commentator calling those who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally \u201cunvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants.\u201d The crowd in Harrisburg, Pa., roared.\n\nTrump continued to call Harris \u201cthe border czar, whether you like it or not\u201d \u2014 a title White House officials have said Biden never gave his No. 2; they contend he put her in charge of diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of illegal border crossings.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to use that term, she was in charge of the border. It\u2019s the worst border in the history of the world,\u201d Trump said, ignoring federal law enforcement agencies\u2019 data that White House and Harris campaign officials have pointed to for weeks showing that border crossings have been declining. In fact, in late June, administration officials said illegal crossings were down 40 percent since Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nHannity did not ask Trump about Harris\u2019 sharp criticism of the effort he spearheaded that led to Republican senators tanking an immigration and border package that one of the most conservative Republicans, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, had negotiated with Democrats and the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions to sink that deal have become Harris\u2019 go-to retort when Trump and other Republicans slam her with the \u201cborder czar\u201d line.\n\nTrump, who is a convicted felon awaiting sentencing in a New York business fraud case, falsely described the United States as being overrun by illegal migrants who were murderers, drug dealers and \u201cwoman traffickers\u201d back home. Then came one of the night\u2019s oddest lines, especially from Trump, who has said negative things about those convicted of violent crimes in major cities with Democratic local and state officials.\n\n\u201cOur criminals are nice people by comparison,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re showing how nice our criminals are.\u201d\n\n\u2018Opportunity economy\u2019\n\nHarris used her campaign event in North Hampton, N.H., to announce her latest economic proposal amid Republican criticism \u2014 including from Trump \u2014 that she had both been complicit in what they call poorly crafted policy under Biden and her lack of a plan of her own.\n\nThe Democratic nominee laid out a proposal to expand the small-business tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000, part of what she described as \u201cbuilding an opportunity economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe America\u2019s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy. Think about it \u2026 small businesses in our country employ half of all private-sector employees,\u201d she said. \u201cThey generate revenue that helps pave our roads and pay our teachers.\u201d\n\nIn a clip-and-save moment, she also set a goal of 25 million small-business applications during her four-year term, if elected in November. Harris described her plan as \u201cessentially a tax cut for starting a small business.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s campaign touted analyses from financial firm Goldman Sachs that estimated, should Democrats sweep both chambers of Congress and the White House, job growth would be 10,000 better per month than if Trump won with a divided Congress \u2014 and 30,000 higher per month under a GOP sweep.\n\nBut the Trump campaign described her announcement as a \u201csham small business \u2018plan.\u2019\u201d In a statement, his campaign contended that \u201cKamala\u2019s $20 billion plan is just another cog in the wheel of her multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending scheme that would add trillions to the debt and drive costs up even higher.\u201d\n\nHarris is attempting to pivot to the middle, while Trump\u2019s campaign wants to paint her as a progressive pretending to be a populist.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t trust women\u2019\n\nHarris\u2019 stop in the Granite State was not all about her small-business proposals \u2014 she also again went right after Trump.\n\nA rally-goer appeared to yell out, \u201cLock him up,\u201d referring to the once-convicted and twice-impeached Trump\u2019s legal cases. Harris did not venture into the legal realm, however.\n\n\u201cThe courts are going to handle that, and we will handle November,\u201d she fired back, to loud applause. \u201cHow about that?\u201d Later, she accused Trump of aiming to \u201cterminate the Constitution.\u201d\n\nShe accused the former president of \u201cgaslighting\u201d voters on the end of federal abortion rights, noting that he had appointed three of the Supreme Court\u2019s six right-leaning justices who voted to do so.\n\nShe alleged that Trump would, if elected, create a \u201cnational anti-abortion coordinator, which would force states \u2026 to report on women\u2019s miscarriages and abortions,\u201d she said, adding of Republicans: \u201cThey don\u2019t trust women.\u201d\n\n\u201cOurs is a fight for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it is a fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nTrump often refers to \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d Democrats. Harris wants to flip that charge on him."

            "text": "For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow would back US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, in presidential elections in November.\n\nThe nature of Putin\u2019s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.\n\nYet whatever Putin\u2019s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader\u2019s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.\n\nThis is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate. Putin himself has been in Russia\u2019s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.\n\nAl Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president\u2019s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.\n\nDid Putin endorse Harris?\n\nAt an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his \u201cfavourite\u201d.\n\nSince Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin\u2019s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.\n\nHe added that Harris has an \u201cexpressive and infectious laugh\u201d, which indicates \u201cshe\u2019s doing well\u201d. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m insulted or he did me a favour,\u201d Republican challenger Trump responded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.\n\n2004: Putin endorses Bush\n\nIn October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the \u201cspread of terrorism\u201d globally.\n\nBush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nThis was amid the war on Iraq which started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.\n\nBush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.\n\n2008: Russia leans towards Obama win\n\nWhile Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain was Russia\u2019s preferred outcome.\n\nWhile both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.\n\nAfter being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.\n\nHence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in \u201ctandemocracy\u201d.\n\nObama won the 2008 election.\n\n2012: Putin praises Obama\n\nAhead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was \u201can honest person who really wants to change much for the better\u201d.\n\nRomney had deemed Russia the top \u201cgeopolitical foe\u201d of the US, something Putin said Romney was \u201cmistaken\u201d about, during the same interview.\n\nObama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.\n\n2015: Putin deems Trump \u2018outstanding and talented\u2019\n\nAhead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.\n\n\u201cHe is a bright and talented person without any doubt,\u201d he said, adding that Trump is \u201coutstanding and talented\u201d.\n\nTrump was up against Democratic challenger Hilary Clinton in the election.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election victory, Putin said Trump was a \u201cclever man\u201d who would \u201cquickly understand\u201d his role in office.\n\n2016: US blames Russia for DNC leaks, election interference\n\nIn July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails were hacked and leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nPutin denied Russia\u2019s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. \u201cThe important thing is the content that was given to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.\n\n2019: Putin jokes Russia will meddle in 2020 election\n\nIn October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret: Yes, we\u2019ll definitely do it. Just don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.\n\nHe then said his working relationship with Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.\n\n\u201cWe have our own problems,\u201d he said."

She has also pledged to take aim at high prescription drug prices, expensive grocery bills, and Wall Street\u2019s home buying spree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs analysts, the best outcome of the 2024 presidential election, at least for the economy, would be a Harris win and a Democratic sweep of Congress. The worst scenarios occur when Former President Donald Trump gets back into office and implements tougher controls on immigration and high tariffs on imported goods, the analysts said.\n\nTrump\u2019s economic proposals would also increase the federal deficit by $5.8 trillion over the next decade, almost five times more than Harris\u2019 proposals, which would add $1.2 trillion, according to recent studies from The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model."

            "text": "Top Gear presenter Chris Harris has ripped open the bonnet on one of the darkest chapters in the motoring show\u2019s history \u2014 and it makes ugly listening for the BBC.\n\nAppearing on The Joe Rogan Experience, Harris revealed that he warned the BBC that \u201csomeone is going to die\u201d on Top Gear unless health and safety standards were improved.\n\nHarris said he made his concerns known months before co-host Freddie Flintoff suffered serious facial injuries during an accident at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey on December 13, 2022.\n\n\u201cThree months before the accident, I\u2019d gone to the BBC and said: \u2018Unless you change something, someone\u2019s going to die on this show,\u2019\u201d Harris told Rogan.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe automotive journalist said he felt a responsibility to the safety of his co-presenters, Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness, because he was the most experienced driver of the three.\n\nBBC Studios\n\nHe continued: \u201cI said: \u2018If we carry on, at the very least we\u2019re going to have a serious injury and the very worst, we\u2019re going to have a fatality \u2026 All too often, I saw situations where it got too dangerous.\u201d\n\nHarris pointed to an incident in Thailand, during which he and McGuinness rode engineless go-karts down a dusty hill. He broke his hand during filming and said it was a \u201cs*** piece of television.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did the right thing, I went to the BBC, and I found out that no one had taken me very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a bit of digging afterwards. The conversation I had with those people was sort of acknowledged. Then they tried to shut me down.\u201d\n\nHarris said he was blocked from accessing two inquiries into the Flintoff accident, though he acknowledged that he was talked through some of the findings. \u201cThe whole situation was ridiculous,\u201d he said.\n\nBBC Studios, the production arm that made Top Gear, declined to comment beyond previously released statements about the Flintoff accident.\n\nIn 2023, BBC Studios revealed that an independent health and safety review found that Top Gear complied with policies and industry best practices, but recommended that \u201cincreased clarity on roles and responsibilities and better communication between teams\u201d was needed if the show returns.\n\nHarris said the shoot at Dunsfold Park on the day of Flintoff\u2019s accident was \u201crushed.\u201d He was driving a three-wheeled open-top Morgan Super 3, which flipped over, causing facial injuries and broken ribs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a physical specimen, Fred. He\u2019s a big guy \u2014 six foot five, six foot six, strong. And if he wasn\u2019t so strong, he wouldn\u2019t have survived \u2026 he\u2019d have just snapped his neck. He\u2019d be dead,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe presenter claimed that he was not looked after by the BBC after the show was taken off the road: \u201cThey left me to rot \u2026 They just sort of left me to sweat, really. I just sat and drank whiskey. I didn\u2019t have much contact with them at all. Everything went quiet.\u201d\n\nThe incident has sparked speculation about the future of Top Gear, with BBC sources telling Deadline that the show may never return. The BBC insists that no decision has been made.\n\nHere\u2019s the full Chris Harris interview:"

            "text": "Israel will cease to exist if United States Vice President Kamala is elected to the White House in November, former President Donald Trump has claimed.\n\nAddressing Jewish donors in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday, the Republican nominee claimed that Harris would \u201ctotally abandon\u201d Israel as president and that \u201cterrorist armies\u201d would wage war to \u201cdrive Jews out of the Holy Land\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou are going to be abandoned if she becomes president, and I think you have to explain that to your people. Because they don\u2019t know it. They have no idea what they are getting into,\u201d Trump said in a remote address to the Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to have an Israel \u2026 if she becomes president. Israel will no longer exist.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would ban refugees from \u201cterror-infested areas\u201d including Gaza, arrest \u201cpro-Hamas thugs\u201d who vandalise government property, and cancel funding and accreditation for universities that spread \u201canti-Semitic propaganda\u201d if elected to a second term.\n\nUS university campuses earlier this year were rocked by protests over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, triggering claims of anti-Semitism along with counterclaims that accusations of bigotry were being used to silence legitimate criticism of Israeli policy.\n\nTrump, who claimed Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel would not have happened if he was president, also took aim at Jewish people who vote for Democratic candidates, claiming he had done more for Israel than any other US president.\n\n\u201cWho are the 50 percent of Jewish people that are voting for these people that hate Israel and don\u2019t like the Jewish people?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are they, why are they voting? How do they exist?\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s remarks, Harris campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said the vice president \u201cstands steadfastly against anti-Semitism\u201d and has been a \u201clifelong supporter of the State of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people\u201d.\n\nFinkelstein also said Trump had a history of demeaning Jewish people and associating with far-right figures, including holding a private dinner with white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes.\n\n\u201cHe has said the only people he wants counting his money are \u2018short guys wearing yarmulkes\u2019, and praised neo-Nazis who chanted \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 as \u2018very fine people\u2019,\u201d Finkelstein said.\n\nHarris has largely echoed President Joe Biden\u2019s staunch support of Israel, resisting pressure from the progressive wing of her party to halt shipments of weapons being used by Israeli forces in Gaza.\n\nThe Democratic nominee has, however, placed greater emphasis on the plight of Palestinians in public statements, saying she will not be \u201csilent\u201d about the suffering in Gaza and that \u201cfar too many\u201d innocent civilians have been killed in the war."

Sherrod Brown can win in Ohio by losing less in rural counties\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Kiger for NPR\n\nMAHONING COUNTY, OH \u2014 It\u2019s fair season in Ohio. And the Canfield brings in a diverse crowd. Boasting as the second largest fair in the state, Canfield attracts fairgoers with sausages, vinegar fries and even the occasional political merch.\n\nOn each side of the grounds are political tents promoting the county parties. The Democrats give out friendship bracelets and signs, excited to engage with fellow Democrats in the red state. The Republicans sell hats and T-shirts, laughing that it might be the cheapest things to buy at the fair.\n\nStill, while both parties get attention from their own, they both see frustrations from residents passing by. The chair of the Mahoning County Democrats complains about \u201ctrolls\u201d coming to their tent. A GOP volunteer with the Mahoning County Republicans waves at people entering the fair \u2014 but gets glares.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe interactions, positive and negative, show the remnants of what was once considered a swing county. Mahoning County voted for Democratic presidential candidates for decades \u2014 until 2020.\n\nAhead of the 2024 presidential election \u2014 Ohio is not one of the key swing states Democrats are aiming to win. And Republicans consider themselves a shoo-in. But the state is still one of a handful that could help determine control of the Senate. Democrat Sherrod Brown is hoping to outrun his entire party in Ohio to keep his Senate seat and he\u2019s banking on voters from rural Eastern Ohio to help him do it.\n\nBrown has a long history of success here and Democrats will need turnout in this region once again if he is to survive a challenge from Bernie Moreno, a Republican backed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nThis time Democrats hope Brown can win the state by losing by less in counties like Mahoning.\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Kiger for NPR\n\n\u201cIf we cut down that margin, it's losing by less in those areas. That makes all the difference in these races,\u201d said Chris Anderson, chair of the Mahoning County Democrats. \u201cSo it's a lot of showing up for those voters and letting them know that we're going to continue to show up, not show up every four years.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAcross the fairground, Tom McCabe, chairman of the Mahoning County GOP, tends to his tent. He celebrates that Republicans have won over voters in the county, swinging it away from Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt's exciting to be a part of this because when I was a young Republican and it was brutal in this area,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt's all red now. And it's those rural voters.\u201d\n\nBrown is a unique candidate\n\nIn 2018, he won in areas of northeast Ohio counties that voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. And though he lost in the historically Republican counties along the river that year he did so by far less than Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Joe Biden also performed worse than Brown did in these areas two years later.\n\nLoading...\n\nNow, Brown is the last state-wide elected Democrat in the state. The results of the 2024 election could cement the GOP\u2019s hold on the state. In past elections, Brown had a unique track record of turning out support for himself from voters that other Democrats \u2014 like Barack Obama, Clinton and Biden \u2014 did not. But this time the first time he\u2019s run in a presidential year since 2012 when he shared the ticket with Obama. And Republicans believe Trump\u2019s enormous draw in this area could lead to the end of Brown\u2019s success.\n\nLoading...\n\n\u201cWe're expecting that we're going to win Mahoning County again for Trump,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cOur big job is to win it for Bernie Moreno. And it's going to be a little bit tougher because Sherrod Brown is well known.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like McCabe said that this race is an uphill battle even amid the red wave that has taken place since the last time Brown ran.\n\n\u201c[Brown] is a popular politician. He connects with the people. We believe Bernie does, too,\u2019 McCabe said. \u201cBut we're running against an old time name that still has a lot of union support in Mahoning County.\u201d\n\nThe illusive split ticket voter\n\nThe eastern part of Ohio along the river used to be one of the regions that kept Ohio a Democratic state. The area voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Brown received strong swaths of the vote. Then the loss of union labor and economic opportunity hollowed out democratic support, according to organizers, and they found support in Republicans and Trump.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIn the eastern part of the state, you can really see\u2026 how strong those areas were for Democrats. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that those are manufacturing communities,\u201d said Matt Hildreth, executive director of the Ohio-based group Rural Organizing. \u201cStill to this day, those communities are looking for a champion.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Kiger for NPR\n\nOrganized labor still holds large electoral power in the region. And Brown has a Senate record he wants to promote.\n\nAs a part of his official duties as a Senator, Brown attended a recent event at a union hall in Warren and the reopening of a manufacturing plant in West Virginia. Speaking to potential voters, and card-carrying union members, Brown boasted of \u201cstanding up to Presidents in both parties.\u201d Brown said he pushed back against aluminum subsidies that he said create unfair trade threatening Ohio workers and boasted about the 600 new jobs the plant will provide in 2026.\n\nThe crowd was ready to vote for Brown.\n\n\u201cI've been up since yesterday. I worked midnights last night, 10:30 to 6:30 and got off, went to breakfast with a couple of my union brothers and came over here from Canton,\u201d said Joe Plott, who works for TimkenSteel. \u201cWe\u2019re here to support Senator Brown.\u201d\n\nHe is prepared to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot but said it's not unusual to hear from those around him that they may split their ticket \u2014 meaning vote for Trump, a Republican, and also Brown, a Democrat.\n\n\u201cThere is what Brown could do for Ohio and what Trump will do for the nation and bringing back Make America Great Again. So I think that's how they separate it,\u201d Plott said.\n\nDoug Zamborski, a health and safety engineer for the new plant in Weirton is one of those people. He said he is \u201c100%\u201d going to vote for Brown and he is also going to vote for Trump. He likes the message of not relying on manufacturing imports and tariffs for the steel industry.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cWe need in-house support, Mr. Brown does that,\u201d Zamborski said. \u201cI believe that Trump can do that. That's why I vote the way I vote.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Kiger for NPR\n\nSplit ticket voters show there is still work for both parties to do in this region. It\u2019s not just about mobilizing voters affiliated with a party. Down the Ohio River Valley, unaffiliated voters overwhelmingly outnumber those who have registered to vote with a party \u2014 a result of the state\u2019s open primary system. The trend is also true statewide .\n\nRepublicans have increased their winning margins, and more unaffiliated voters have switched to the GOP than to the Democrats \u2014 solidifying Ohio\u2019s broader status as a Republican state.\n\nSherry Cappelli, a union member at Astro Shapes, an aluminum extrusion plant, said she used to consider herself a \u201cbig Trump supporter.\u201d She voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but she says she could be open to hearing what Vice President Kamala Harris has to say.\n\nBut Capelli is more sure when it comes to Brown.\n\n\u201cI just like everything that he says and does. You know, he's a good guy,\u201d Cappeli said.\n\nOhio rural voters drawing attention from both parties\n\nAccording to a Brown campaign official, a coordinated campaign effort called Organizing for Ohio started earlier with the goal of knocking on doors in every county. They are working with nearly 500 volunteers in rural counties to mobilize voters for Brown, which the campaign said includes a higher number of volunteers in rural areas than they had in 2018. They also hope to knock on doors in every county.\n\nStill, organizers acknowledge this election will be tough for Brown with Trump on the ballot.\n\nBroadly across the country, organizers said they have seen an increase in groups outside of political parties working to engage Democrats, and rural voters, generally.\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Kiger for NPR\n\n\u201cIf you go back to 2016, there would often just be one strong rural community organizing group in most states, and some didn't have that,\" said George Goehl, co-founder of Addition, a rural and labor-focused organizing group. \u201cNow in so many states you point to three or four solid community organizing groups working in rural parts of their state, and I expect that number to grow.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome organizations branched out into voter mobilization and candidate election efforts want to do more than lose by less. One such group in Ohio is Justice For Migrant Women, which launched its civic engagement efforts in 2018.\n\n\u201cThere's just this desert in terms of the information we're getting\u2026 But then that intersects with the civic desert, which means that people, campaigns, politicos, are not investing in engagement in rural America,\u201d said Monica Ramirez, president of Justice for Migrant Women. \u201cIt's about time the people are finally focusing on our communities because we have a lot to say and we're contributing in big and small ways every single day.\u201d\n\nThey have gone to county fairs for voter education, created programs to encourage women to run for office and provided ride services to polling locations.\n\nAlso hoping to revitalize political engagement is Hildreth's group Rural Organizing. Originally founded in Ohio, the now national organization aims to engage rural progressive political action. Working with 2,500 volunteers, they have placed 18,000-yard signs and hope to disburse 20,000 more \u2014 some in support of candidates like Brown.\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Kiger for NPR\n\n\u201cYou got to be the big tent. You've got to reach out to people if you want their votes,\u201d said Marjie DeFede, a volunteer with Rural Organizing out of Steubenville, Ohio.\n\nShe said women, people of color and younger voters that could be ripe for the Democratic vote are ignored in the rural parts of eastern Ohio and the party needs a plan to win them back.\n\n\u201cThey need a long range plan because they didn't lose their influence in all these offices overnight,\u201d DeFede said. \u201cSo it's going to take a while to get that back.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like McCabe see that success in rural Ohio over the last eight years as a positive factor for their odds of flipping the seat.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cWhen we get to the rural areas, the margins are so huge that we overtake them now. And so that's where we're hoping to see this November,\u201d McCabe said, adding that it\u2019s the rural precinct results that will come last. \u201cSo that last report at 11:00 pm, I think we're going to catch Sherrod Brown that night.\u201d"

Republicans have been able to win over larger percentages of whites without college degrees, while Democrats have gained with college-educated white voters and Asian Americans, while also largely maintaining advantages with Black voters and Latinos.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStill, issues matter. The fundamentals on various issues favor Republicans, from views of the economy to immigration, which is why demographics are not necessarily destiny. But they are a crucial part of explaining the political shifts, where the campaigns are focused, and why the seven states everyone is watching most closely are, in fact, the current crop of swing states.\n\nNPR utilized data and projections from William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, as well as presidential exit polls conducted by Edison Research to do a deeper dive into the data and see what it could mean for this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nHere are eight important findings:\n\nLoading...\n\n1. White voters without college degrees have declined as a share of the electorate everywhere pretty significantly since 2008, while Latinos, AAPI voters and whites with degrees have increased dramatically\n\nWhites without degrees were a majority of voters overall in 2008, but are now projected to be less than 40% in 2024.\n\nThey are down dramatically in all three Blue Wall states as well since 2008: 12 points in Pennsylvania, 8 in Michigan and 7 in Wisconsin. This is happening without much change to nonwhite groups in the Blue Wall states.\n\nAmong the seven swing states, the increase in Latinos has been especially acute in Arizona and Nevada, where they now represent 3-in-10 eligible voters in Arizona and 1 in 5 in Nevada. At the same time, white non-college voters are down significantly in the four Sun Belt swing states since 2008: 14 points in Nevada, 13 in Arizona, 13 in North Carolina and 10 in Georgia.\n\nLoading...\n\n2. White non-college voters, though, continue to be the largest portion of eligible voters in all of the key swing states\n\nIn the Blue Wall states, white non-college voters make up a significant share of the eligible voting population \u2014 half or more.\n\nTrump turned them out in greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016. But Biden was able to win all three Blue Wall states because he ate into Trump\u2019s margins with the group in Wisconsin and Michigan and kept it even in Pennsylvania, while also turning out nonwhite groups in his favor.\n\nIn fact, Biden did better than Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, with white non-college voters in five of the seven swing states.\n\n\n\n3. Democrats have held up in the Blue Wall states because white non-college voters vote differently there than in the South \u2014 and the Blue Wall has more college-educated white voters than at any other time\n\nWhite voters without degrees in the two southern swing states, Georgia and North Carolina, are much more conservative.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn average in the Blue Wall states, Trump won whites without degrees 61%-38% in 2020, according to exit polls. In Georgia and North Carolina, on the other hand, Trump won them by an average of 79%-21%.\n\nThat's a 23-point margin vs. 58 points.\n\nIn Arizona and Nevada, whites without degrees voted more like those in the Blue Wall.\n\nWhites with degrees, meanwhile, are on the rise in the Blue Wall states \u2014 up 8 points in Pennsylvania, 6 points in Wisconsin and 5 points in Michigan since 2008. In Wisconsin, they're up 4 points just since 2020.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Blue Wall, either. White college-educated voters shifted heavily away from Trump almost everywhere. In Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, they moved away from Trump by double-digits \u2014 by 30 points in Georgia, 19 in North Carolina, 13 in Arizona and 9 in Nevada.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 performance with college-educated white voters is one underreported reason the party continues to stay competitive against Trump.\n\n\n\n4. The Sun Belt continues to diversify, and that has put it on the map for Democrats\n\nWhite voters are down double-digits since 2008 as a share of eligible voters in Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina, and 9 in Georgia. It's a huge change that has put these states in play.\n\nLatinos and AAPI voters are up significantly in these places as well. Latinos are up 10 points in Arizona, 7 in Nevada, have doubled their eligible-voter population in Georgia and quadrupled in North Carolina since 2008.\n\nOf the swing states, AAPI voters could have the largest impact in Nevada, where they are now almost 10% of the eligible voter population. While AAPI voters are smaller portions of the electorate in other swing states, they have doubled as a share of eligible voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in that time.\n\nThat trend is only going to continue, because, as of right now, a majority of those under 18 are nonwhite. Gen Z is forecast to be the last generation that is majority white .\n\nNotably, these demographic shifts have helped Democrats to statewide victories for the Senate and governorships. Six of the eight Sun Belt swing-state senators now either are Democrats or caucus with them. That\u2019s a big change from 2008, when seven of the eight were Republicans.\n\n(In the Blue Wall, five of the six senators are Democrats, the same margin as 2008.) Overall, five of the seven swing-state governors are also currently Democrats.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n5. The Sun Belt rises in the East \u2014 while Georgia and North Carolina are similar, they are also different in key ways\n\nBoth of these Sun Belt states are diverse, have similar Latino, AAPI and white non-college populations.\n\nBut two things make them distinct from each other: Georgia has a larger Black population, and North Carolina has more white college-educated voters.\n\nNorth Carolina white voters with degrees also vote more for Democrats than those in Georgia do. In 2020, for example, Trump won college-educated white voters in Georgia by 11 points, but Biden won them by 1 in North Carolina.\n\nThe size of the Black population in Georgia \u2014 1 in 3 eligible voters \u2014 also generally gives a Democrat a better chance than in North Carolina. That is part of the reason why both senators in Georgia are Democrats, but both in North Carolina are Republicans.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of reducing the margins with college-educated whites or Harris potentially winning them by bigger margins than in 2020, as lots of polls have shown this cycle, which could keep North Carolina\u2019s vote margin very close.\n\n\n\n6. How the West is being won (by Democrats)\n\nDemocrats have made major inroads in Arizona, while maintaining close but consistent victories in Nevada.\n\nLatinos are key in both places. Arizona\u2019s eligible-voter population is 28% Latino, up from 19% in 2008. Nevada is 20%, up from 13% in the same time period. As noted earlier, AAPI voters are also crucial in Nevada, up from 7% to 10% since 2008.\n\nThose increases are crucial for Democrats, especially in Nevada, where just 19% are whites with college degrees, the lowest of any of the seven states.\n\nIn fact, Nevada has the lowest level of college attainment of the seven states \u2014 just 27% have college degrees, which tends to make for a less politically engaged population and one that is most likely to engage now, post-Labor Day and up to Election Day.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn other words, you can probably throw out all the polls up until Labor Day in Nevada.\n\n\n\n7. It's also important to look at who actually votes\n\nAbout 8 in 10 college-educated white voters cast ballots in presidential elections, compared to 6 in 10 or less of whites without degrees.\n\nLoading...\n\nTrump has turned out whites without degrees at higher rates than in the past \u2013 64% in 2020, for example. His campaign\u2019s theory is that it\u2019s a group Trump still has room to grow with.\n\nThat could be true, but turnout will likely be down overall compared to 2020 just by virtue of the fact that mail-in voting is not as widely available \u2014 and it\u2019s very difficult to buck turnout trends with lower-propensity voters, experts say.\n\nThat\u2019s partially why whites with degrees are 26% of the eligible voter population, but projected to be 32% of the actual voters in 2024. White non-college voters are projected to be higher than that at 38%, but that would be the closest the two groups have ever been.\n\nJust how big a change is that? In 2008, white voters without degrees were 51% of actual voters, compared to 28% of whites with degrees.\n\n\n\n8. Latinos continue to be underrepresented at the ballot box\n\nWhile Latinos are 14% of the eligible voter population overall, Brookings projects them to be just 11% in 2024.\n\nWhy? It tracks with history, including 2020, when Latinos made up 13% of eligible voters, but voted at less than 11%.\n\nStill, their continued increases, especially in the Southwest, make Latinos a politically powerful group."

            "text": "In his first appearance as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live tonight, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff faced a comical version of a question that has been asked of his wife, Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nKimmel asked, \u201cWhat was your reaction when your wife turned Black? Were you surprised?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that stuff, you know, it\u2019s a distraction. We can joke about it, but it\u2019s literally a distraction, so all the insults, all the things coming at her, coming at me, coming at our family, it is really a distraction from what they are trying to do,\u201d Emhoff responded.\n\nKimmel was referencing Donald Trump\u2019s questioning last month of Harris\u2019 racial identity, something that she has dismissed as the \u201csame old tired playbook\u201d rather than take the bait from her GOP rival.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nEmhoff was a Los Angeles entertainment lawyer for 30 years before he became the first Second Gentleman when his wife became the first woman vice president in 2021. As she seeks to become the first female president, he gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in which he highlighted her personal side.\n\nHe did so again on Kimmel\u2019s show, as he described how they first realized they had each worked at McDonald\u2019s in their younger days. Harris has cited that fast food experience as she focuses her campaign on bolstering the middle class. Emhoff noted that when he worked there, he once became Employee of the Month.\n\nIronically, since Harris launched her presidential bid after Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Emhoff said that it has been a bit of a whirlwind, with less \u201chappy couple\u201d time available between him and his wife.\n\n\u201cEverything has changed, and it is like being shot out of a cannon,\u201d Emhoff told Kimmel.\n\nEmhoff made clear to Kimmel that he did not play a part in Harris\u2019 selection of a running mate, nor is he helping her in debate preparations.\n\nWhen it comes to the campaign, Emhoff said, \u201cThe last thing I am going to do is give her advice on something she is really awesome at\u2026.If she asks me something I will let her know what I think but we really try to keep that separate because we really want to be there for each other, our family, our kids, all that stuff.\u201d\n\nEmhoff has been giving speeches and headlining fundraisers, including an appearance at a Los Angeles event this evening.\n\nKimmel asked about the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling that the president has immunity from prosecution for official acts carried out while in office. The president \u201ccan do pretty much what the president wants to do,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cAs her husband, does that worry you at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce she gets elected, you know, it gets interesting, \u201d Emhoff said, in a bit of deadpan.\n\n\u201cAs she is preparing for the debate, somebody asked me,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2018Well what is it like debating her? You are both trial lawyers. Have you ever?\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I have never won one.\u2019 And so I am looking forward to this.\u201d"

            "headline": "Kamala Harris\u2019 Secret Weapon When It Comes to the Economy",
            "text": "All year, the most troubling issue facing the Democratic Party has been the economy. Troubling for the humdrum political reason that voters kept saying they hated the economy, and for the warped bizarro-world reason that the economy was, by any historical standard, in great shape. Pandemic-era inflation had been vanquished, jobs were more plentiful than they\u2019d been in half a century, wages were rising, bank-account balances were up \u2026 and polling majorities consistently painted an apocalyptic portrait of an economy mired in recession, with record unemployment.\n\nTennis players can challenge the refs when they make a bad call. In politics, voters get the final word; yelling at them is a fool\u2019s errand. On the economy, the issue that voters quite reasonably cited as the most important, Democrats seemed stuck heading into the November election.\n\nBut a strange thing happened when President Joe Biden passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris. Voters started to cheer up about the economy. Harris still has plenty of work to do\u2014the public consensus remains in Trump\u2019s favor\u2014but a positive shift in attitudes is showing up across different measures of economic sentiment. The University of Michigan recorded a one-month improvement of nearly 5 percentage points in the August edition of its long-run economic expectations survey, while Gallup recorded a 7-percentage-point increase in the number of people saying the economy was \u201cgetting better\u201d and a modest gain in overall economic confidence. Most importantly, Harris has significantly blunted Trump\u2019s head-to-head polling edge on who would best handle the economy. According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, Trump\u2019s lead on the economy has slipped to just 6 points, down from 14 in June, when Biden was still in the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what is perhaps most interesting about this improvement in economic perception is that the numbers are improving even as the economy appears to be softening a bit on some important measures\u2014not much, but a little. The unemployment rate has been drifting higher all year, from 3.7 percent in January to 4.3 percent at the end of July. The pace of job growth has been slowing, with the economy adding just 99,000 jobs in August, according to payroll processing firm ADP\u2014the fourth consecutive month that job growth has declined, while wage growth in the ADP survey held even at 4.8 percent.\n\nBy historical standards, these figures remain excellent. You expect the economy to add fewer jobs when the unemployment rate is very low, because a good job market has less room for improvement than a bad one. And the job market is still very good. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Barack Obama never delivered a single month with unemployment at or below 4.3 percent; Biden has now secured nearly three consecutive years of it. The point is not that the economy suddenly torpedoed but rather that a burst of unexpected good news doesn\u2019t seem to account for improved voter opinion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s always risky to place too much emphasis on a single month of data, but in this election, there aren\u2019t many months to work with. The August improvement in economic sentiment could be random data noise, or it could be a product of gas prices falling by about 25 cents a gallon over the course of the month. But I think the most likely explanation is Harris replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic Party ticket.\n\nConsider the University of Michigan survey. The economic outlook improved by 4.8 percent in August, but when you break that down by political affiliation, you see that among Republicans, it actually fell by 10 points, almost exactly offsetting a rise among Democrats. Gallup too shows a massive gulf between Republican and Democratic assessments of the economy. I don\u2019t think that this is because the left and right go to different gas stations. When Biden took office in January 2021, voter assessments of the economy abruptly flipped, with Democrats giving it high marks and Republicans saying that it was awful. Harris\u2019 entering the race is having a similar if more modest impact. Democrats and independents are immediately feeling better about the world, and this positivity is showing up in their views on the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate The Single Issue That Has Finally Healed the Democratic Party Read More\n\nSome of this is just because Harris is not Joe Biden. Despite overseeing an outstanding run of economic management, Biden will finish his time in office as one of the most consistently unpopular presidents in American history. Biden has a lot going against him\u2014political leaders throughout the developed world have fared poorly this year, and Biden, as you may have heard, is very old. But Harris is also doing a lot of things right on the economy. Her economic platform is simple, prudent, and thoughtful, and over the past few weeks, she and vice presidential nominee Tim Walz have defended the Biden administration\u2019s economic record better than anyone from the White House to date.\n\nWhen asked in her CNN interview what Harris would do on Day 1, she described her plan to attack price gouging in grocery stores, make homes more affordable, and expand the child tax credit to as much as $6,000 per child. Cranks are howling apocalyptic warnings about \u201ccommunist\u201d Harris and her \u201cfederal price controls,\u201d but these policies are popular, and they make a lot of sense. The battle for inflation is basically over for now. Since October 2023, the Fed\u2019s preferred metric for inflation has been below 3 percent\u2014a level common to the Bush presidencies and which nobody at the time associated with inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut people still say they don\u2019t like inflation, which matters politically, and in any case it\u2019s a good idea to develop a plan for the next supply shock to help prevent the sudden and rapid expansion of corporate profits from driving up consumer prices. (The International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and other economic authorities have cited corporate profits as a major driver of postpandemic inflation.) Indeed, while antitrust policy has been reinvigorated under Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, it\u2019s important for antitrust regulators to keep an eye on household essentials to confirm that collusion and concentration aren\u2019t unnecessarily pushing up costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harris housing plan is even better\u2014offering various perks to entice homebuilders into constructing 3 million new houses, combined with smart market design to ensure that large corporations don\u2019t devour the consumer benefits of expanded supply. Her $25,000 down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers is designed with the 2008 housing crash firmly front of mind. You can make it easier to get a loan by either lowering lending standards (hmm) or strengthening household finances so that they qualify for higher standards (ah!). Down-payment assistance is a particularly good way to subsidize home purchases because it gives buyers instant equity in their homes, making the prospect of foreclosure much more remote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, yes, raising children in the U.S. today is too expensive and too stressful. An extra $6,000 can\u2019t fix everything for a new family, but it can fix, well, about $6,000 worth of trouble. Easing family financial pressures may even help new parents get some sleep.\n\nBut the best moments for Harris in her CNN interview were about what the Biden\u2013Harris administration has already done on the economy. When CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked why Harris hadn\u2019t already implemented her Day 1 agenda, Harris responded not by distancing herself from the unpopular Biden but by emphasizing his achievements: capping the price of insulin at $35 a month for seniors, lowering the price of prescription drugs through Medicare (scary price controls!), creating over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, fixing supply chains \u201cso that we\u2019re not relying on foreign governments to supply families with their basic needs,\u201d getting inflation down below 3 percent as \u201cAmerica recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say that\u2019s good work,\u201d Harris concluded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, one of her signature proposals\u2014the expansion of the child tax credit\u2014is essentially a ramped-up version of a program that Biden ran in 2021, which, as Harris emphasized to Bash, dramatically reduced child poverty. \u201cWe cut child poverty in America by over 50 percent,\u201d Harris crowed, slightly overstating the impact (it was 46 percent).\n\nThese policies are popular. Insofar as good, popular policies can help a presidential candidate, they will help Harris. But her best asset on the economy is probably Harris herself. Just by running, Harris has injected an optimism into politics that Americans haven\u2019t felt in a very long time. And the better Americans feel about their future, the more they like what Kamala Harris has to say about the economy."

            "headline": "Navy SEAL who killed Bin Laden slaps hotel with lawsuit over incident that derailed career: 'Didn't happen'",
            "text": "FIRST ON FOX: Former Navy SEAL Rob O\u2019Neill, the man credited with killing Usama Bin Laden, is speaking out after recently filing a lawsuit against the hotel where he allegedly assaulted a security guard and used a racial slur, which he vehemently denies and says has crippled his business career.\n\n\"I've lost a ton of business. There was a point in my career where I was giving 300 speeches in one year, between 250 and 300 speeches and that many cities in a year, and now it's just dried up, because it\u2019s a bad look that didn't happen,\" O\u2019Neill told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview about the notorious incident at the Omni Hotel in Frisco, Texas, in August last year when he was accused of assaulting a loss-prevention officer while intoxicated and calling that guard, who is White, the \"N word.\"\n\nO\u2019Neill, a former SEAL Team Six member who has received two Silver Stars and four Bronze Stars, says he never assaulted anyone and never used the slur, which prompted him to file a lawsuit against the Omni Hotel. In the lawsuit, O\u2019Neill argues that the security guard, Johnny Lee Loomis, should never have been hired, due to his allegedly checkered past, and alleges that he made false statements about that night.\n\n\"Hotel Defendants knowingly, recklessly, and negligently hired and retained Loomis as a security guard, despite Loomis\u2019 publicly available history as a pedophile and child sex purveyor,\" the lawsuit states. \"Hotel Defendants also knowingly, recklessly, and negligently hired and retained Loomis as a security guard despite his known history of violence and of making false accusations of violence and misconduct against Hotel guests.\"\n\nCONVICTED PEDOPHILES COULD FACE MUCH DARKER FUTURE WITH GOP-BACKED BILL: 'CAN'T REHABILITATE A PREDATOR'\n\nRob O'Neill speaks to Fox News Digital about his lawsuit against a Texas hotel.\n\nO\u2019Neill acknowledges that he had had a drink after a long day after a speaking engagement, falling asleep at the hotel bar, and that he had encountered Loomis while trying to get back into his room, but denies striking Loomis or calling him a racial slur.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It had been a long day flying from New York to Dallas, and then we had a dinner meeting and whatnot and went to the cigar bar and then came back, and generally just being in a hospitality environment such as a hotel, you know, you sit at the bar having a try to have a nightcap and then fell asleep at the bar, which, unfortunately, has happened before and then getting semi-escorted up to my hotel room, which is fine. I guess that can happen,\" O\u2019Neill recounted.\n\n\"It's odd that it's only one guy that did it. It's odd the way that he knew he was going to a place with no audio and video, and also it's just odd that he's trying to use my wallet, my key, when as a loss-prevention officer, he has a key to a room. And any time I've seen it happen or been around security guys from a hotel, they have their own key. They don't need the guy's keys. So I was actually surprised at first when the police showed up.\"\n\nHARRIS VP PICK SPENT YEARS PROMOTING RESEARCH FACILITY THAT COLLABORATED WITH 'CHINESE MILITARY COMPANY'\n\nO\u2019Neill continued. \"It wasn't until later that I found out that not only had I been accused of assault, I'd been accused of using a racial slur. And that, to me, was odd, too, along with the one guy escorting me up to him being a middle-aged white guy, like a dude in his 60s and all of a sudden he's claiming assault and claiming a racial slur, which with two guys alone in a hallway is just to me, silly.\"\n\nO\u2019Neill said the slur is a \"horrible word\" that he would \"never use\" and says he supports law enforcement and was treated well by local police, but alleges in the lawsuit that Loomis has a track record of false statements and altercations with guests.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Loomis has \"been involved in several other physical altercations with guests at the Hotel\" and that in one case, Loomis \"published false statements and instigated that guest\u2019s arrest, claiming the guest had started the altercation.\"\n\n9/11 VICTIMS' RELATIVES BLAME 'SPINELESS' POLITICAL LEADERS, SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BIN LADEN LETTER GOING VIRAL\n\nRobert O'Neill, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, speaks at the \"Best of Blount\" Chamber of Commerce awards ceremony at the Clayton Center for the Arts in Maryville, Tennessee, on Nov. 6, 2014.\n\n\"On at least one occasion before August 22, 2023, law enforcement personnel specifically warned Hotel Defendants about Loomis and his background,\" the lawsuit states. \"Yet, Hotel Defendants retained Loomis in his supervisory role, giving him continued, unsupervised access to Hotel premises and guests of all ages. Hotel Defendants also took no remedial or disciplinary action against Loomis.\"\n\n\"This lawsuit seeks substantial compensatory and punitive damages against Hotel Defendants for negligent hiring, screening, retention, and supervision arising from Hotel Defendants\u2019 employment of Loomis, for Loomis\u2019 false statements, and for events that occurred at the Hotel on or about August 22, 2023,\" it said.\n\nThe lawsuit also states that Loomis did not hold the proper security guard registration credentials in accordance with Texas law and that Louisiana law enforcement, where Loomis had been previously employed, had called to warn the hotel about Loomis and the hotel continued employing him.\n\nO\u2019Neill told Fox News Digital that a main reason he filed the lawsuit was to restore his name that he says has been forever sullied due to false allegations.\n\n\"There's a ton of damage done, and the internet is forever,\" O'Neill said. \"And it's just hard to just sit here and say, well, that's not really me, when it's already out there. People that know me know this is not me. Obviously, I want to restore my reputation. I want to restore the way my family is treated and the way that they think about my reputation and their relationships with me. And most importantly, I've been thinking about this for a year, and I assure you, that's a long time to keep my mouth shut, especially with my platforms. But, I really don't want anyone else to have to deal with this.\"\n\n\"When my grandkids Google my name or Neptune's Spear or 9/11, this article that's not even true will come up, and that affects everything from my family life, my legacy, my business, my military career,\" O'Neill added.\n\n\"Even friends and family, when they've gone places, they've heard whispers and stuff like that, it's just, it's a shame. And. I mean, the lawsuit speaks for itself, but again, just the fact that there are people out there that will print anything for a headline.\"\n\nFormer Navy SEAL and Valor Award honoree Robert J. O'Neill attends the Salute to Heroes Service Gala to benefit the National Foundation for Military Family Support at The Majestic Downtown in Los Angeles on March 14, 2015.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Omni Hotel, which provided the following statement: \"On August 23, 2023, the Frisco Police Department was dispatched to the Omni Frisco Hotel at The Star due to a disturbance call regarding guest, Robert O\u2019Neill. Upon arrival on the scene, the responding police officers conducted their own investigation and made the determination to take Mr. O\u2019Neill into custody.\"\n\n\"The Frisco Police Department arrested Mr. O\u2019Neill for public intoxication and assault. The security staff at the Omni Frisco Hotel at The Star followed all appropriate protocols to ensure the safety of its guests and associates.\n\n\"We will let due process play out in the court of law. Omni Hotels & Resorts followed all standard and legal protocols, including background checks upon hiring Mr. Loomis, which includes all national registries. No convictions and arrests were found. Omni has placed Mr. Loomis on suspension while this incident is under investigation. There will be no further comment at this time.\"\n\nLoomis did not respond to Fox News Digital's media inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Navy SEAL who killed Bin Laden slaps hotel with lawsuit over incident that derailed career: 'Didn't happen'"

            "text": "Im New Yorker Prozess um Schweigegeldzahlungen von Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump wird die Strafe erst nach der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl verk\u00fcndet. Richter Juan Merchan gab einem entsprechenden Antrag Trumps statt und legte das neue Datum auf den 26. November fest, wie aus Gerichtsunterlagen hervorging. Zuvor war die Festlegung des Strafma\u00dfes f\u00fcr den 18. September erwartet worden.\n\nTrump f\u00e4hrt damit einen bedeutenden Erfolg im Rennen um das Wei\u00dfe Haus ein. Er hat es geschafft, eine ihn bei der Wahl m\u00f6glicherweise sch\u00e4digende Strafe zu verz\u00f6gern. Der 78-J\u00e4hrige hatte argumentiert, eine Entscheidung zum Strafma\u00df nur wenige Wochen vor der Wahl am 5. November k\u00f6nnte die Integrit\u00e4t der Abstimmung beeinflussen.\n\nRichter Merchan schrieb zur Begr\u00fcndung seiner Entscheidung: \u00abDieser Fall steht einzigartig da und nimmt in der Geschichte dieser Nation einen einzigartigen Platz ein.\u00bb Die Strafma\u00dfverk\u00fcndung werde vertagt, \u00abum jeden Anschein \u2013 wie ungerechtfertigt auch immer \u2013 zu vermeiden, dass das Verfahren die bevorstehende Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl, bei der der Angeklagte kandidiert, beeinflusst hat oder zu beeinflussen versucht.\u00bb\n\nDas Gericht sei eine faire, unparteiische und unpolitische Institution, so Merchan. Es d\u00fcrfe nicht der Verdacht aufkommen, dass das Gericht eine Entscheidung treffe, um jemandem politisch zu schaden oder zu helfen.\n\nGef\u00e4ngnis droht im schlimmsten Fall\n\nDie Verz\u00f6gerung bedeutet, dass die US-Amerikaner Anfang November w\u00e4hlen gehen, ohne zu wissen, ob der bereits schuldig gesprochene Trump ins Gef\u00e4ngnis muss oder nicht.\n\nIm Falle eines Siegs \u00fcber die demokratische Kandidatin Kamala Harris k\u00f6nnte sich die Festlegung der Strafe zudem weiter verz\u00f6gern. Trump droht im \u00e4rgsten Fall eine mehrj\u00e4hrige Haftstrafe. Einige Beobachter halten eine Bew\u00e4hrungsstrafe aber f\u00fcr wahrscheinlicher.\n\nGeschworene in New York hatten den Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten Ende Mai in 34 Anklagepunkten f\u00fcr schuldig befunden. In dem Prozess ging es um die illegale Verschleierung von Schweigegeldzahlungen an eine Pornodarstellerin, um sich Vorteile im Wahlkampf 2016 zu verschaffen. Es war das erste Mal in der Geschichte der Vereinigten Staaten, dass ein ehemaliger Pr\u00e4sident wegen einer Straftat verurteilt wurde.\n\nWegweisende Supreme-Court-Entscheidung als ein Hebel\n\nAls Hebel diente den Anw\u00e4lten Trumps auch ein weiterer Antrag zur angeblichen Immunit\u00e4t des 78-J\u00e4hrigen nach einem entsprechenden Grundsatzurteil des Supreme Courts. Die Entscheidung dazu legte Merchan auf den 12. November. Sollte er diesem Antrag auch zustimmen, was Beobachter als eher unwahrscheinlich sehen, m\u00fcsste der Prozess vermutlich neu aufgerollt werden.\n\nDer oberste US-Gerichtshof hatte Anfang Juli mit seiner rechtskonservativen Richter-Mehrheit entschieden, dass Trump f\u00fcr gewisse Amtshandlungen Immunit\u00e4t genie\u00dft. Diese historische Entscheidung nutzt Trump, um die verschiedenen Verfahren gegen ihn zu stoppen.\n\nZwar ist der New Yorker Schweigegeldfall an sich anders gelagert, weil er sich in erster Linie um Trumps Handlungen als Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidat vor der Wahl 2016 dreht. Doch das Urteil des Supreme Court besagt auch, dass Amtshandlungen von US-Pr\u00e4sidenten nicht als Beweise in Strafverfahren angef\u00fchrt werden. Trumps Anw\u00e4lte argumentieren, dass die Anklage sich in dem Fall auch auf Beweise gest\u00fctzt hat, die aus Trumps Zeit im Wei\u00dfen Haus stammen.\n\nDas wegweisende Immunit\u00e4ts-Urteil des Supreme Court hat bereits dazu gef\u00fchrt, dass die Anklageschrift im Verfahren wegen versuchten Wahlbetrugs in der US-Hauptstadt Washington von der Staatsanwaltschaft \u00fcberarbeitet wurde.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240906-930-225473/2"

In einer Rede zur Jahreskonferenz der Republican Jewish Coalition, die am Donnerstag in der Gl\u00fccksspielmetropole Las Vegas stattfand, sagte der per Satellitenverbindung zugeschaltete 78-J\u00e4hrige, Harris sei \u201edie Kandidatin der Kr\u00e4fte, die die westliche Zivilisation und Israel zerst\u00f6ren wollen\u201c. Im Gegensatz dazu sei er \u201eder Kandidat jener, die die westliche Zivilisation verteidigen wollen\u201c. Trump brachte Harris mit von Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden verordneten Sanktionserleichterungen gegen\u00fcber dem Iran in Verbindung und warf ihr in dem Zusammenhang vor, Israel die Unterst\u00fctzung entzogen zu haben.

Vance hat f\u00fcr die Pl\u00e4ne von Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump geworben, im Falle seines Wahlsiegs massenhaft Menschen abzuschieben, die sich illegal im Land aufhalten. \u201eIch habe eine Botschaft von Donald J.

Donnerstag, 5. September: 17:23 Uhr \u2013 Kein Publikum, keine Er\u00f6ffnungsstatements \u2013 Harris und Trump einigen sich auf Regeln f\u00fcr TV-Duell Wie der ausrichtende Sender ABC am Mittwoch mitteilte, einigten sich beide Seiten im Detail auf die Regularien f\u00fcr das Duell, bei dem Harris und Trump am kommenden Dienstag erstmals direkt aufeinander treffen. Eine zentrale Festlegung besteht darin, dass das Mikrofon f\u00fcr den Kandidaten stumm geschaltet ist, der gerade nicht an der Reihe ist. Dies soll st\u00f6rendes Dazwischenreden verhindern. Das Harris-Team hatte zun\u00e4chst verlangt, die Mikrofone w\u00e4hrend der gesamten Debatte angeschaltet zu lassen \u2013 wohl weil es davon ausging, dass Trump dann versucht sein k\u00f6nnte, die Debatte mit r\u00fcden Bemerkungen zu unterbrechen und eventuell die Beherrschung zu verlieren. Allein den Moderatoren wird es erlaubt sein, Fragen zu stellen. Die 90-min\u00fctige Debatte wird im National Constitution Center in Philadelphia stattfinden und von den ABC-Journalisten David Muir und Linsey Davis moderiert. Das Duell startet sofort ohne Er\u00f6ffnungsstatements, es wird aber Schlussstatements geben, f\u00fcr welche die Kandidaten jeweils zwei Minuten Zeit haben. Zuschauer wird es nicht im Raum geben. F\u00fcr ihre Antworten haben die Kandidatin und der Kandidat zwei Minuten Zeit, zwei Minuten werden dann f\u00fcr eine Replik zugestanden. 07:35 Uhr \u2013 Foto von Walz-Familie mit Trump-Shirts sorgt f\u00fcr Aufsehen Man muss schon genau hinschauen, um zu verstehen, warum dieses Foto f\u00fcr Aufregung im US-Wahlkampf sorgt: Zu sehen sind acht l\u00e4chelnde Menschen in marineblauen Pro-Trump-Shirts, sie stehen unter einem \u201eTrump 2024 - Take America Back\u201c-Schild \u2013 und sie alle weisen sich als Mitglieder der Familie Walz aus. Tim Walz ist der \u201eRunning Mate\u201c der demokratischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris. Die eigene Familie wendet sich vom Kandidaten ab? Das w\u00e4re Z\u00fcndstoff. Kein Wunder, dass das Foto vom Trump-Unterst\u00fctzern und schlie\u00dflich auch vom ehemaligen US-Pr\u00e4sidenten selbst begeistert verbreitet wurde. Trump schrieb dazu auf seiner Plattform Truth Social: \u201eEs ist eine gro\u00dfe Ehre, Ihre Unterst\u00fctzung zu haben. Ich freue mich darauf, Sie bald kennenzulernen!\u201c\n\nDie Demokraten erwischte der Hype kalt, und sie beeilten sich zu erkl\u00e4ren, dass die Menschen auf dem Foto allenfalls sehr entfernte Verwandte des US-Demokraten seien, die alle im US-Bundesstaat Nebraska lebten. Das gab wenig sp\u00e4ter auch der Initiator der Aktion zu. Zuerst auf X gepostet wurde die Aufnahme von Charles Herbster, einem Ex-Gouverneurskandidaten in Nebraska, der im Wahlkampf 2022 Trumps Unterst\u00fctzung hatte. Herbsters Sprecher Rod Edwards sagte, die Menschen auf dem Foto seien Cousins des Gouverneurs von Minnesota, der jetzt Kamala Harris\u2018 Vizekandidat ist. \u201eDie Familie auf dem Bild sind die Nachkommen von Francis Walz, dem Bruder von Tim Walz\u2018 Gro\u00dfvater\u201c, sagte Edwards. \u201eSie sind alle Walzes und Ehepartner.\u201c Damit handelt es sich bei den Menschen um Cousins zweiten Grades. Walz\u2018 Schwester Sandy Dietrich aus Alliance, Nebraska, sagte, sie vermute, es k\u00f6nnten Verwandte aus einem weit entfernten Zweig der Familie sein. Der Vater von Dietrich und Walz, James Walz, starb 1984 an Lungenkrebs, als der sp\u00e4tere Kongressabgeordnete und Gouverneur von Minnesota noch ein Teenager war. \u201eWir standen ihnen nicht nahe. Wir kannten sie nicht\u201c, so Dietrich besch\u00e4mt.\n\nTim Walz Quelle : REUTERS\n\nZuvor hatte sich aber auch schon Walz\u2018 leiblicher Bruder von dessen Kandidatur distanziert. Jeff Walz schrieb auf Facebook kritisch \u00fcber seinen j\u00fcngeren Bruder: \u201eDie Geschichten, die ich erz\u00e4hlen k\u00f6nnte. Nicht die Art von Person, die man Entscheidungen \u00fcber die eigene Zukunft treffen lassen m\u00f6chte.\u201c Der 67-J\u00e4hrige schrieb auch, er sei \u201ezu 100 % gegen seine gesamte Ideologie\u201c und habe sogar dar\u00fcber nachgedacht, Trump zu unterst\u00fctzen, wie die \u201eNew York Post\u201c berichtete. 05:06 Uhr \u2013 Trump: Ihr m\u00fcsst mich w\u00e4hlen, auch wenn ihr mich nicht m\u00f6gt Der republikanische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidat Donald Trump hat W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hler, die ihn nicht m\u00f6gen, dazu aufgerufen, ihn dennoch zu w\u00e4hlen. \u201eIhr habt keine Wahl.

Auch wenn ihr mich nicht m\u00f6gt\u201c, sagte der 78-J\u00e4hrige bei einer vom US-Sender Fox News ausgerichteten Townhall im US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania. 02:50 Uhr \u2013 US-Republikanerin Cheney will f\u00fcr Harris stimmen\n\nDie prominente US-Republikanerin Liz Cheney will f\u00fcr die demokratische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris stimmen. \u201eAls Konservative, als jemand, der an die Verfassung glaubt und der sie etwas bedeutet, habe ich gr\u00fcndlich nachgedacht. Und wegen der Gefahr, die von Donald Trump ausgeht, stimme ich nicht nur nicht f\u00fcr Donald Trump, sondern ich werde Kamala Harris w\u00e4hlen\u201c, sagte die 58-J\u00e4hrige bei einer Veranstaltung an der Duke-Universit\u00e4t in North Carolina.\n\nUS-Republikanerin Liz Cheney Quelle : AP/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nMittwoch, 4. September: 06:00 Uhr \u2013 Trumps Betrugsprozess wird nicht auf Bundesebene verlegt Ein US-Bundesrichter hat den j\u00fcngsten Versuch von Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump abgeschmettert, gegen seine Verurteilung im Prozess um Schweigegeldzahlungen an eine Pornodarstellerin vorzugehen. Richter Alvin Hellerstein lehnte den Antrag von Trumps Anw\u00e4lten am Dienstag ab, die entsprechenden Dokumente f\u00fcr eine \u00dcbernahme des Falls einzureichen. Es sei ihnen nicht gelungen, der Beweislast nachzukommen, die n\u00f6tig sei, damit ein Bundesgericht den Fall an sich rei\u00dfe. Trump hatte das Bundesgericht des Bezirks Manhattan aufgefordert, das Verfahren zu \u00fcbernehmen. Die Strafverfolgung auf Bundesstaatsebene versto\u00dfe gegen die verfassungsm\u00e4\u00dfigen Rechte des republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten und laufe der Grundsatzentscheidung des Obersten Gerichtshofs der USA zur Immunit\u00e4t von Pr\u00e4sidenten zuwider. Der Schritt des 78-J\u00e4hrigen zielte darauf ab, seine Verurteilung aufzuheben und die f\u00fcr den 18. September angek\u00fcndigte Verk\u00fcndigung des Strafma\u00dfes hinauszuz\u00f6gern. 00:42 Uhr \u2013 Trump pl\u00e4diert auf nicht schuldig Donald Trump pl\u00e4diert nach der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung einer \u00fcberarbeiteten Anklageschrift im Bundesverfahren zu versuchtem Wahlbetrug auch weiterhin auf nicht schuldig. Das geht aus einem von Trumps Anw\u00e4lten eingereichten Gerichtsdokument hervor. Darin hei\u00dft es weiter, dass Trump auf sein Recht verzichte, bei der Anklageverlesung anwesend zu sein. Stattdessen sollten seine Anw\u00e4lte im Namen des Republikaners auf nicht schuldig pl\u00e4dieren 00:16 Uhr \u2013 Sohn des Republikaners McCain stellt sich hinter Harris Der Sohn des 2018 gestorbenen republikanischen Senators John McCain, Jimmy McCain, will die demokratische Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris im Wahlkampf unterst\u00fctzen.

Mitreisende Reporter berichteten, mehrere Autos in der Wagenkolonne seien auf dem Weg zu einer Kundgebung in Milwaukee im Bundesstaat Wisconsin ineinander gefahren. Betroffen seien Wagen mit Reportern und Mitarbeitern des Wahlkampfteams gewesen, nicht aber das Auto mit Walz an Bord.

In einem Tag ist das nicht zu schaffen\u201c, sagte Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow im russischen Fernsehen.

Man k\u00f6nnte sich vorstellen, \u201edass der n\u00e4chste Pr\u00e4sident der USA in seiner Rede zum Amtsantritt verk\u00fcndet, dass die USA f\u00fcr Frieden eintreten und deshalb ihre Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr die Ukraine einstellen\u201c, sagte der Sprecher. \u201eDann ver\u00e4ndert sich zum n\u00e4chsten Morgen vielleicht etwas im Denken, vor allem in Kiew.\u201c Peskow f\u00fcgte in dem Interview f\u00fcr die Sendung \u201eMoskau. Kreml. Putin\u201c aber hinzu, dass dies alles rein hypothetisch sei. Die USA seien durch ihre Waffenlieferungen f\u00fcr die Ukraine schon sehr weit Teil des Konflikts, sagte der Sprecher von Pr\u00e4sident Wladimir Putin. Das Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen Moskau und Washington sei deshalb so schlecht wie seit Jahrzehnten nicht. Offiziell hielt Peskow an der Linie fest, dass Russland im Wahlkampf zwischen Trump und der Bewerberin Kamala Harris von der Demokratischen Partei niemanden bevorzuge. 08:37 Uhr \u2013 Familien der Afghanistan-Gefallenen solidarisieren sich mit Trump Das Gezerre um eine Gedenkfeier auf dem Soldatenfriedhof in Arlington weitet sich aus: Nachdem US-Vizepr\u00e4sidentin Kamala Harris Donald Trump bei X vorgeworfen hatte, dass Gedenken an die bei dem R\u00fcckzug der US-Armee aus Afghanistan gefallenen Soldaten f\u00fcr Wahlkampfzwecke zu nutzen, schalten sich nun die Familien der Get\u00f6teten ein. In Videos, die auf der Plattform X verbreitet werden, loben die Angeh\u00f6rige \u2013 darunter V\u00e4ter und M\u00fctter der jungen M\u00e4nner \u2013 ausdr\u00fccklich den Auftritt von Trump bei den Feierlichkeiten drei Jahre nach deren Tod. Mehr noch: Sie erkl\u00e4ren, dass sie selbst es waren, die den ehemaligen US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten eingeladen haben, weil sie sich von ihm Trost und Unterst\u00fctzung erhofft haben und auch bereits bekommen h\u00e4tten. Von der amtierenden US-Regierung unter Joseph \u201eJoe\u201c Biden und seiner Vizepr\u00e4sidentin sei bisher wenig bis gar keine Anerkennung f\u00fcr die Toten und deren Opfer gekommen, hei\u00dft es.\n\nAcht der 13 Familien, die Tote zu beklagen haben, meldeten sich mittlerweile bei X in Videobeitr\u00e4gen zu Wort, die Beitr\u00e4ge wurden insbesondere von den Republikaner nahestehenden Accounts und auch Trump selbst weiterverbreitet. So \u00e4u\u00dferte sich etwa der Vater von Lance Corporal Jared M. Schmitz, der klare Worte in Richtung von Kamal Harris fand: \u201eWarum wollten wir Trump dort haben? Es ging nicht darum, seinen Wahlkampf zu unterst\u00fctzen. Wir wollten einen Anf\u00fchrer. Das erkl\u00e4rt, warum Sie und Joe keinen Anruf bekommen haben.\u201c Dar\u00fcber hinaus wirft er Harris und auch Joe Biden komplettes Desinteresse an dem Schicksal der gefallenen Soldaten vor. Mehr als drei Jahre h\u00e4tten sie, die Familien, gewartet, und nicht mal einen Anruf, einen Ausdruck des Mitgef\u00fchls erhalten. Niemals seien die Namen ihrer Kinder etwa bei einem offiziellen Anlass, im Kongress oder bei der Ansprache zur State of The Union auch nur erw\u00e4hnt worden, so der sichtlich verbittere Vater. Auch J. D. Vance, Trumps Kandidat f\u00fcr den Posten des Vizepr\u00e4sidenten, meldete sich zu Wort. Er schrieb auf X an die Adresse von Kamala Harris: \u201ePr\u00e4sident Trump war auf Einladung von Familien dort, deren Angeh\u00f6rige aufgrund Ihrer Inkompetenz gestorben sind. Warum verlassen Sie nicht die sozialen Medien und leiten eine Untersuchung ihrer unn\u00f6tigen Tode ein?\u201c\n\ndpa/AFP/Reuters/AP/saha/shem/krott/lk/jml"

            "text": "Kamala Harris\u2019s ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has eliminated Donald Trump\u2019s polling lead and allowed Europeans to contemplate alternatives to what would be their worst-case scenario. Yet, even if Harris wins, it would be foolish to expect complete continuity with the Biden administration.\n\nBERLIN \u2013 With the US election just two months away, European decision-makers have gone from grappling with Trumpian nightmare scenarios \u2013 new trade wars, abandoning Ukraine, withdrawing from NATO \u2013 to experiencing an emotion they had almost forgotten: hope. Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has eliminated Donald Trump\u2019s polling lead and allowed Europeans to contemplate alternatives to their worst-case scenario.\n\nYet, even if Harris wins, it would be foolish to expect complete continuity with Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Europe remains unprepared for what\u2019s coming.\n\nWhile Trump and J.D. Vance\u2019s talk of ending US support for Ukraine has set off alarms in European capitals, a Harris administration\u2019s Ukraine strategy probably would depart from the status quo, too. As the war grinds on, US officials have lost confidence that Ukraine will capture and hold enough ground to break the current deadlock. Despite the Ukrainians\u2019 offensive into Russia\u2019s Kursk region, they are still losing ground in Donetsk. Recovering the territory they have lost since February 2022 becomes more unlikely by the day.\n\nThus, a Harris administration would have to look for ways to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s hand in the short term in order to pivot toward a settlement. Knowing better than anyone that their situation is bleak, the Ukrainians have been looking for a way out of the stalemate. Though they have launched their Kursk gambit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in July that he wants the \u201chot stage\u201d of the war to end this year. Privately, Ukrainian leaders may be hoping that the United States will push them to the negotiating table, as that would provide the political cover they need to change course. Such discussions are already well underway in Washington.\n\nThis might come as a shock to those Europeans (including the next high representative for foreign affairs) who still talk about supporting Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes,\u201d and whose rhetoric has hardly changed since February 24, 2022. Whatever happens, the challenge for Europeans is to ensure that the war does not result in a \u201cpeace\u201d on Russian terms: a demilitarized Ukraine that is forced to abandon its aspirations to join NATO and the European Union.\n\nTrade policy will be another major issue. Trump is promising a blanket 10% tariff on all imports, and new tariffs of 60% or more on all goods from China (in addition to all the restrictions already introduced by the Biden administration). Faced with US tariffs and pressure from the Trump administration to apply its own tariffs on Chinese goods, Europe would find itself in an extremely difficult position.\n\nDon\u2019t go back to school without Project Syndicate!

Subscribe Now\n\nBut, again, there is no reason to expect that Harris would have a significantly softer China policy than Biden (whose approach has been much tougher than Trump\u2019s was while in office). The anti-China consensus in the US is solid, and in her few public statements on the matter, Harris has voiced strong support for Taiwan and complained about China dumping \u201csubstandard products into our economy.\u201d While her running mate, Tim Walz, has visited China many times, he has done so largely as an advocate of human rights.\n\nUnlike Trump, Harris has been vocal in her support for America\u2019s network of alliances. But this commitment might make her expect more from US allies. Moreover, since she is no dyed-in-the-wool Atlanticist like Biden, the broader trend of US foreign policy shifting away from Europe and toward Asia would persist. When Europeans talk about investing more in defense, they should ask themselves whether they are merely trying to placate Trump, or whether they are genuinely serious about providing for their own long-term security.\n\nMuch of the task of envisioning what a Trump or a Harris presidency would mean for Europe will fall on the new European Commission, which will have to start preparing Europeans so that they do not panic if their biggest fears regarding Ukraine or China are realized. Failure to do so will increase the likelihood of a disjointed response, with smaller member states possibly peeling off to pursue bilateral deals with the US. It will be up to the bigger countries to calm their smaller counterparts (many of them in eastern Europe).\n\nTo that end, recasting relations with the United Kingdom could be a game-changer. If the EU and the UK can work in lockstep on geoeconomic issues, they will have more policy leeway and clout vis-\u00e0-vis the US and China. Although Britain cannot replace the US, its reintegration into European defense and technology frameworks could significantly bolster the continent\u2019s strategic position. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s new government has already embarked on an enhanced security and defense partnership with Germany, and similar deals with likeminded members could follow, culminating in a pact with the EU as a whole.\n\nPoland and the Baltic and Nordic countries will likely take the lead in pursuing this outcome, but French President Emmanuel Macron may emerge as the key swing vote. Will he embrace a geopolitical vision of bringing the UK into the European fold on defense, technology, and climate issues? Or will he channel Charles de Gaulle by sidelining Britain, thus weakening the EU in the process? One thing is clear: Whether the next US president is Trump or Harris, Europeans must start planning for a change."

            "headline": "Trump, Harris, and Communism",
            "text": "Kamala Harris has \u201cvowed to lower prices at the grocery store with price controls and open up the increasingly out-of-reach housing market with tax subsidies for homebuyers.\u201d Harris asserts that she \u201cwill work to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food. Her plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Donald Trump said that Harris has gone \u201cfull communist.\u201d\n\nBut what does \u201cfull communist\u201d even mean to generations of young people who have no idea what communism has wrought in the world?\n\nAt the American Institute for Economic Research a reader learns that:\n\nMost people in [communist] Cuba are skipping meals [.] These shortages of food are intimately linked with socialist governments, related economic policies, and, in particular, price controls. In July, Cuban authorities imposed a new round of price controls on powdered milk, chicken, and pasta, among other goods. Vendors in Cuba are now not allowed to sell chicken parts above a price of 680 pesos, whereas market prices are typically around 700 pesos. Price controls are huge red flags. These are not red flags celebrating socialism. Price control\u2019s reddest flags relate to the nature of exchange, morality, and freedom [emphasis mine].Price controls increase poverty and hunger. Contrary to the utopian dreams of policymakers, price controls distort market activity in perverse ways.\n\nAnd they always lead to shortages.\n\nRecently, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson commissioned a study looking into creating grocery stores operated by the city of Chicago. The move \u201cby Mayor Johnson is a step to implement a communist system where the city or state owns the production and distribution of food, which history shows us [always ends] disastrously.\u201d\n\nAs goes Cuba -- so goes America?\n\nFurthermore, \u201cGrocers aren\u2019t price gouging consumers. They\u2019re struggling to survive.\n\n[Moreover] it\u2019s not only the farmers who are suffering. It\u2019s the truckers -- it\u2019s the transporters -- it\u2019s the people who bring the stuff into the store.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 \u201cfix\u201d would \u201cbring devastating consequences on the entire nation by crippling the desire to produce, which in turn will only bring higher prices and empty shelves.\u201d\n\nOther Harris/Walz ideas include: \u201c\u2026a push to build three million new housing units to fight the housing crisis, $25,000 in taxpayer money to provide down-payment support to first time homebuyers, and a plan to expand the child tax credit.\u201d\n\nThese ideas will only drive up inflation.\n\nAyn Rand in an essay in the Readers Digest of January 1944 explains that \u201c[t]otalitarianism is collectivism. Collectivism means the subjugation of the individual to a group -- whether to a race, class or state does not matter. Collectivism holds that man must be chained to collective action and collective thought for the sake of what is called \u2018the common good.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 1960 Richard M. Nixon, then Vice President of the United States wrote that:\n\nCommunism will supplant and destroy the market economy of capitalism. The production and distribution of goods [would be] put under central direction, the theory being that the flow of goods would be directed by social need without reference to principles of profit and loss. The other obstacle to the realization of a free market lies in the simple fact that the government owns the whole of industry [emphasis mine].\n\nHarris comes from a background that espouses Marxist-Leninist ideas.\n\nHer father was a committed Marxist.\n\nCalifornia State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown had deep communist ties. He appointed Harris to key positions. Brown is widely \u2018regarded as one of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s best friends in the Bay Area.\u2019\n\nHarris argued an amicus brief in 2008 that the \u2018Second Amendment does not protect an individual\u2019s right to own a gun.\u2019\n\nIn early 2013, Harris\u2026 urged President Barack Obama to award, posthumously, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the late Fred Ross Sr., a Saul Alinsky-trained radical [.]\n\nHarris\u2019 husband, Doug Emhoff, was a partner from 2017-2020 with the law firm DLA Piper, which... \u2018boasts nearly 30 years of experience in China and over 140 lawyers dedicated to its \u2018China Investment Services\u2019 branch.\u2019 The company employs a host of former Chinese Communist Party officials.\n\nIn addition, Harris has stated that she will:\n\ntake away private health insurance.\n\nhave American taxpayers pay for the healthcare of every illegal immigrant in America.\n\nextend Medicare coverage to 20+ million illegal immigrants.\n\nban fracking.\n\nsupport a woke agenda on crime to defund police.\n\nfree people arrested for violent crimes.\n\nsupport a public education system where schools can hide information from parents.\n\nhas proposed $14.5 trillion in new spending resulting in more inflation.\n\nTim Walz inclinations are:\n\ntaught history and English to teenage students in China. The program was paid for by the Chinese government, and was made possible by a friend of Walz in China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Department. Walz began this endeavor just months after the Communist Chinese government had slaughtered hundreds to thousands of pro-democracy protesters in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nIn a letter he wrote as governor of Minnesota, Walz boasted that his state \u2018has promoted Minnesota\u2019s connections with China and hosted numerous senior Chinese leaders for decades.\u2019\n\nDuring an August 12, 2024 appearance on the Breitbart News Daily podcast, bestselling author Peter Schweizer stated that Walz remained connected to the Chinese government through \u2018secret police stations that the Chinese have here in the United States,\u2019 to intimidate Chinese expatriates living in the U.S. who are critical of the CCP. Schweizer then cited one alleged CCP police station that was \u2018tied to a group called Minnesota Global, which is a Tim Walz organization.\u2019\n\nHistory has repeatedly shown that \u201c\u2026 [t]he premises of Communist philosophy make any coherent theory of freedom impossible [.]\u201d\n\nAnd, in fact, the Democrats are targeting the Constitution\u2019s guardrails in every realm.\n\nWalz and Harris\u2019 beliefs are reminiscent of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution.\n\nAmericans cannot ignore the naked lies of communism.\n\nBolshevism, in its various incarnations, collapsed in Europe, yet it is alive in China, Cuba, and a few other places. Maoism is the Chinese version of Leninism, and its recognition of market mechanisms does not diminish the totalitarian features of the system: one-party dictatorship, ubiquitous propaganda, censorship, secret police, a cult of personality, and the persecution of dissidents. The lie is the eternal soul of communism.\n\nMoreover, at the Democratic National Convention, the Bill of Rights was denigrated with a call to re-imagine democracy.\n\nAs Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn said: \u201cTo achieve its diabolical ends, Communism needs to control a population devoid of religious and national feeling, and this entails the destruction of faith and nationhood. Communists proclaim both of these objectives openly, and just as openly go about carrying them out.\u201d\n\nAnd for the Democratic Party, the government trumps your religion.\n\n\u2018The injustices of communism were not limited to mass murder alone. Even those fortunate enough to survive still were subjected to severe repression, including violations of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, loss of property rights, and the criminalization of ordinary economic activity.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s stance on gun control should be a warning signal to all Americans.\n\nAnd it cannot be forgotten that the Left are allies of Islamic radical organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Harris is no stranger to this organization.\n\nObfuscation, numerous falsehoods, and outright lies are the hallmark of the Harris/Walz team.\n\nHence, Trump is absolutely correct about Harris \u201cgoing full communist.\u201d\n\nG-d forbid she should succeed.\n\nEileen can be reached at middlemarch18@gmail.com\n\nImage: AT via Magic Studio"

Trump hatte zuvor mit der Idee gelieb\u00e4ugelt, mit Importz\u00f6llen die pers\u00f6nliche Einkommensteuer zu ersetzen, was sich als arithmetische Herausforderung darstellt: Importz\u00f6lle steuern aktuell 2 Prozent der Staatseinnahmen bei, w\u00e4hrend knapp die H\u00e4lfte der Einnahmen aus der pers\u00f6nlichen Einkommensteuer stammen."

Die anderen laufen aufgeregt durchs Bild - aber da ist das kurze Instagram-Video der \"Nelkboys\" schon zu Ende. \"Kamala wird niemals meine Pr\u00e4sidentin sein\", kommentieren sie darunter.\n\nDie beiden Szenen sind nur zwei Ausschnitte daraus, wie der Republikaner Trump versucht, seine Basis zu mobilisieren, um die Euphoriewelle der Demokraten um Harris im November \u00fcbersp\u00fclen zu k\u00f6nnen. Die Podcaster \"Nelkboys\" geh\u00f6ren zu mehreren Influencern in den sozialen Medien, die mitunter viele Millionen Zuh\u00f6rer haben und von Trump umgarnt werden. Die US-Medien nennen es auch die \"Bro-Vote\": Stimmen von Freundesgruppen junger M\u00e4nner. Sie geh\u00f6ren h\u00e4ufig zur Arbeiterschicht, haben also keine h\u00f6here Bildung und tendieren zu einem traditionelleren Verst\u00e4ndnis von M\u00e4nnlichkeit. Sie waren das Fundament f\u00fcr Trumps Wahlsieg 2016 gegen Hillary Clinton. Sie sollen es auch 2024 gegen Harris sein.\n\nFrauen besonders motiviert\n\nImmer dann, wenn es in den USA um Wahlen geht, fangen Analysten, Strategen und Meinungsforscher an, die Bev\u00f6lkerung in kleinstm\u00f6gliche Gruppen aufzuteilen: nach Wohnort, Einkommensschicht, Bildungsniveau, Herkunft und Hautfarbe, Geschlecht und Gender. Seit klar wurde, dass Harris die Kandidatin der Demokraten ist, haben sich die Umfrageergebnisse zugunsten der Vizepr\u00e4sidentin verschoben; nun liegt sie in den mutma\u00dflich wahlentscheidenden Bundesstaaten statistisch gleichauf mit Trump. Auch was die Begeisterung f\u00fcr den jeweiligen Kandidaten angeht, gibt es bei Demokraten und Republikanern keinen Unterschied mehr.\n\nIst bei weiblichen W\u00e4hlern meilenweit im Vorteil: Kamala Harris. (Foto: REUTERS)\n\nDabei bildet sich eine Grundfrage heraus: Bringt die \"Bro-Vote\" Trump ins Wei\u00dfe Haus? Oder schaffen es die Frauen, Harris als erste US-Pr\u00e4sidentin \u00fcberhaupt \u00fcber die T\u00fcrschwelle zu tragen? Die Demokratin hat insbesondere bei jungen, nicht-wei\u00dfen und weiblichen W\u00e4hlern an Zustimmung gewonnen, wenig oder gar keine bei \u00e4lteren W\u00e4hlern sowie wei\u00dfen M\u00e4nnern. Auch bei unabh\u00e4ngigen W\u00e4hlern hat Harris derzeit einen Vorteil.\n\nLandesweit liegt die Demokratin zwei Monate vor der Wahl 1,8 Prozent vor ihrem Widersacher. In den battleground states Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania und Wisconsin sind es die Frauen, die Trump durch alle Altersgruppen hindurch rechts liegen lassen und damit Harris in Umfragen nach oben dr\u00fccken. Den Unterschied machen die jungen Frauen zwischen 18 und 29 Jahren; und der ist gigantisch: Harris f\u00fchrt unter Frauen der Generation Z mit 38 Prozent, Trump bei den m\u00e4nnlichen Altersgenossen mit 13 Prozent. Die beiden Gruppen liegen historisch weite 51 Prozent auseinander und 12 Prozent weiter als bei Biden.\n\nReicht das?\n\nDie Gr\u00fcnde sind vielf\u00e4ltig, aber haben eine lange Vorgeschichte. Junge Frauen sind politisiert durch die #MeToo-Enth\u00fcllungen sexueller Angriffe, die Abschaffung des allgemeinen Abtreibungsrechts durch den konservativ dominierten Supreme Court, und jetzt durch die Aussicht, erstmals in der Geschichte der USA eine Frau zur Pr\u00e4sidentin zu machen. Trump eiert seit Jahren opportunistisch um die Abtreibungsfrage herum, auch der aktuelle Wahlkampf ist keine Ausnahme. Handfest ist das aktuelle Gesetzeschaos, f\u00fcr das er mitverantwortlich ist. Schlie\u00dflich hatte er das Urteil des Obersten Gerichts durch seine Richternominierungen m\u00f6glich gemacht.\n\nF\u00fcr Frauen unter 45 Jahren sind inzwischen die reproductive rights, also alle Rechte rund um die Schwangerschaft, das wichtigste Wahlthema, vor der Wirtschaft. Trump m\u00e4andert in der Frage zum Abtreibungsrecht. Er ist gefangen zwischen konservativen, h\u00e4ufig christlichen W\u00e4hlern, die Verbote bef\u00fcrworten, und der Aussicht, wegen zu extremen Positionen im November zu verlieren. Mit gro\u00dfem Abstand wird Harris als kompetenter angesehen als Trump, was Frauenrechte angeht. Die Demokraten haben k\u00fcrzlich einen reproductive freedom Bus auf eine Reise durch alle Bundesstaaten geschickt. Zu Beginn fuhr er an Trumps Anwesen in Mar-a-Lago in Florida vorbei.\n\nDie Bustour wird im November kaum den entscheidenden Unterschied machen, m\u00f6glicherweise aber ein weiteres Problem, das den Republikaner plagt. Das Bildungsniveau im sogenannten Rostg\u00fcrtel, wo wei\u00dfe Arbeiter vor acht Jahren Trump den Wahlsieg brachten, steigt kontinuierlich. Obwohl W\u00e4hlergruppen nie homogen sind: Wei\u00dfe US-Amerikaner mit h\u00f6herer Bildung w\u00e4hlen tendenziell eher Demokraten, und das noch mehr in den battleground states. Die Frauen gegen sich, ein dynamischer Wahlkampf der Widersacherin, eine m\u00f6glicherweise schrumpfende Basis - ob Trump diese Nachteile mit der \"Bro-Vote\" ausgleichen kann?"

            "text": "\u201cPrima avevamo Biden come favorito, ma \u00e8 stato escluso dalla corsa. Lui ha raccomandato a tutti i suoi sostenitori di appoggiare Harris, quindi lo faremo anche noi\u2026 lei ha una risata cos\u00ec contagiosa, il che vuol dire che le cose le vanno bene\u201d. Aveva un sorriso malizioso, Vladimir Putin, mentre ieri pronunciava queste parole davanti all\u2019uditorio dell\u2019Eastern Economic Forum di Vladivostok. Al netto della dichiarazione di appoggio, quello dello zar non era un endorsement, anzi. Il presidente russo ha lanciato alla candidata democratica una stoccata sul suo modo di ridere, proprio come \u00e8 solito fare Donald Trump. che ha definito quella dell\u2019avversaria nella corsa per la Casa Bianca \u201cuna risata da pazza\u201d e ha detto che le viene \u201cimpedito di ridere, altrimenti perde\u201d.\n\nNon \u00e8 un mistero, Putin \u00e8 tra i leader mondiali che accoglierebbero con soddisfazione la vittoria del miliardario alle presidenziali del 5 novembre. Se \u00e8 vero che la sua amministrazione ha adottato diverse misure contro Mosca \u2013 ha buttato alle ortiche i trattati sul disarmo nucleare firmati negli anni \u201980, ha messo al bando l\u2019azienda russa Kaspersky Lab, ha istituito la \u201cUs Space Force\u201d e ha inviato un numero maggiore di soldati lungo il fianco orientale della Nato \u2013 lo zar ha spesso manifestato simpatia per l\u2019ex presidente. Lo aveva scelto gi\u00e0 nel dicembre 2015 in vista delle presidenziali vinte l\u2019anno successivo \u2013 \u201cE\u2019 una persona vivace e talentuosa. Non spetta a noi valutare i suoi vantaggi ma \u00e8 un leader assoluto della campagna presidenziale\u201d -, gli ha accordato spesso parole di stima, in genere lette come veri e propri endorsement. Come lo scorso 9 febbraio: \u201cAvevo un buon rapporto con Trump, non \u00e8 una questione di leader nelle relazioni tra Usa e Russia \u00e8 una questione di mentalit\u00e0\u201d. E quella degli Usa \u201c\u00e8 di dominare a ogni costo\u201d. Difficile non leggere un riferimento alla politica di disimpegno americano sulle scacchiere geopolitico inaugurato dal tycoon negli anni trascorsi nello Studio Ovale.\n\nMa poich\u00e9 a Putin piace anche intorbidire le acque, pochi giorni dopo era sembrato tornare sui suoi passi: il 15 febbraio aveva detto che \u201cpreferirebbe\u201d Biden perch\u00e9 \u201cpi\u00f9 esperto e pi\u00f9 prevedibile\u201d. Per poi cambiare di nuovo versione, ma in un\u2019apoteosi di ironia, il 22: \u201cAvevo detto che per noi Biden \u00e8 preferibile come presidente, e a giudicare da quello che adesso ha detto, ho assolutamente ragione\u201d, aveva detto lo zar riferendosi al capo della Casa Bianca che poche ore prima gli aveva dato del \u201cpazzo figlio di puttana\u201c. \u201cCerto \u2013 aveva chiosato ironico -, non mi avrebbe potuto dire \u2018Volodya, sei bravo, grazie, mi aiuti moltissimo\u2019\u201d. Poco dopo era tornato a schierarsi con Trump, nella consapevolezza che una vittoria di quest\u2019ultimo infastidirebbe non poco le democrazie occidentali proprio per l\u2019imprevedibilit\u00e0 del personaggio, definendo i processi contro di lui una \u201cpersecuzione giudiziaria\u201d (5 giugno) e giudicando \u201csincere\u201d le sue assicurazioni sulla volont\u00e0 di mettere fine al conflitto in Ucraina (4 luglio).\n\nNon \u00e8 un caso che il falso endorsement alla Harris sia arrivato all\u2019indomani delle accuse penali e delle sanzioni annunciate dagli Usa contro i tentativi russi di influenzare nuovamente le elezioni americane seminando divisioni e disinformazione tramite Russia Today (Rt) ed altri media o piattaforme online controllate da Mosca. Un\u2019operazione \u201corchestrata dall\u2019inner circle dello zar\u201c, \u00e8 la valutazione della Casa Bianca e degli 007 americani, secondo cui il Cremlino preferisce il tycoon a Harris, proprio per la sua posizione sulla guerra in Ucraina.\n\n\u201cPutin deve finirla di parlare delle nostre elezioni, di interferire nelle nostre elezioni. Punto. Non dovrebbe favorire nessuno in un modo o nell\u2019altro\u201d, ha replicato il portavoce del consiglio per la sicurezza nazionale John Kirby mentre il portavoce del Cremlino Dmitri Peskov negava ogni ingerenza: \u201cI nostri media stanno facendo il loro lavoro. Stanno solo riportando la verit\u00e0, ma sfortunatamente agli americani non piace la verit\u00e0 scomoda per loro e, quando emerge, immediatamente attuano delle repressioni contro di essa\u201d."

            "headline": "The Moral Case Against Reparations",
            "text": "In an April 5, 2019 appearance before the National Action Network, presidential candidate Kamala Harris declared to Al Sharpton that she will sign a \u201creparations\u201d commission into law. During last week\u2019s interview on CNN, Harris affirmed that \u201cMy values have not changed.\u201d That would include the values that deem America paying descendants of slaves monetary compensation a requirement of social justice. Social justice warriors assume it is a noble cause. But the reality is that reparations are not merely impractical but profoundly immoral. Here\u2019s five basic reasons why the moral case is against reparations.\n\nThe Legal Problem\n\nFirst, reparations, to be just, must be based on the legal definition of restitution. In the law, restitution exists to achieve an equitable remedy when the money or property is, first, wrongfully possessed and, second, traceable. Today\u2019s calls for reparations fail to show that any money or property is currently wrongfully in anyone\u2019s hands. Money and property (and the slaves themselves) were, indeed, wrongfully in the hands of slave-holders but not even the law is capable of re-writing history. It can only cure current injustices.\n\nThe money and property that could have been restituted after the demise of slavery is no longer traceable. Even if I\u2019ve inherited cash and property from my slave-holding ancestors, which of it is from them? My car? My house? How much of my money? It\u2019s all jointly owned by my wife who has no ancestors who were plantation owners. She\u2019s not even American. Legally, since the reward for stolen labor is long ago untraceable, it\u2019s impossible to claim any of it as belonging to a former slave. To take property from me to redistribute to someone whose ancestors had labor stolen from them would be illegal and immoral.\n\nFurther, in the law, restitution is designed to restore injured parties to the position they enjoyed prior to the wrong suffered. Reparationists typically assume that descendants of slaves should be reimbursed as if their ancestors had been American laborers. But that wasn\u2019t their original position. They were originally west Africans, frequently prisoners of tribal wars. Restitution is supposed to, as far as possible, make the victim whole, to return to the state before the damage. Thus, the norm to which current descendants of slaves would be restored would be that of the standard of living of current west Africans. The average life-span of Nigerians is about 53 years with an average annual income of $2,080; for African-Americans, the life-expectancy is about 77 years and annual income $46,400. This doesn\u2019t mitigate the horror of slavery or the evils of racism. However, it does cause us to put quotation marks around \u201creparations\u201d since they are not really geared to return the (descendants of) victims to their original condition.\n\nThe USA\u2019s Enormous Sacrifice\n\nSecond, some reparations were already paid in the enormous sacrifice the USA expended to free the slaves, including about 360,222 lives cut short. I\u2019ve yet to see a restorationist tip a hat to the United States\u2019 costly losses in the war that became necessary to end slavery in America. If reparations are to be made for the unrequited labor of the slaves, we would have to subtract from what is due the expenses the USA paid out to end slavery and the estimated wealth those 360,222 men would have made had they been able to live out their lives. Ingratitude is a form of immorality and reckoning reparations without gratitude for the tremendous cost the United States expended to free the slaves is immoral.\n\nThe Prohibition of Intergenerational Punishment\n\nThird, the Bible forbids punishing people for the sins of their ancestors. \u201cThe son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son.\u201d (Ezekiel 18:20a.) Since intergenerational reparations necessarily involve punishing people from whom the money is taken, they are prohibited.\n\nMy ancestors were slave-holders. They had a large plantation, like out of Gone With the Wind, in Georgia. They got wealthy off the backs of the stolen labor of people they unjustly held prisoner. They lost much of their wealth in the Civil War, as they deserved. Their emancipated slaves deserved reparations. As far as I know, they didn\u2019t get it. But I\u2019m not guilty of my ancestor\u2019s sin and so I don\u2019t owe the descendants of my ancestors\u2019 slaves reparations. To take money from me to repair for a crime my ancestors committed is itself a crime.\n\nMuch of the argumentation for reparations today glides over the fact that we\u2019re now talking about intergenerational restitution, removed by about six generations. David Licicum\u2019s 2022 Christianity Today does this. Thabiti Anyabwili deals with inter-generational penalty problem in his 2019 TGC article, \u201cReparations Are Biblical,\u201d as does a 2021 Sojourners article, Using the Bible to Debunk 10 Myths About Reparations. Sometimes it takes more words to debunk an error than it does to declare it. This is one of those times and I\u2019m up against the word-limit. So, if you want more debunking of their arguments, subscribe to my Substack (see below). For now, suffice it to say that violating the explicit command of Ezekiel 18:20 is immoral.\n\nNo Limiting Principle\n\nFourth, there\u2019s no limiting principle to reparations, as now proposed. This is critical when it comes to slavery. Slavery had existed for all of human history among all cultures and races. The case for reparations is made as if the only kind of slavery was that of the American South, only suffered by African-Americans. But in reality, if we go back far enough, all of us probably are the descendants of slaves and enslavers. If reparations are to be paid for past slavery, why limit it to only African-Americans or American history? Maybe your Viking ancestors pillaged and enslaved my Anglo-Saxon ones? Pay up! Of course, that would be immoral.\n\nReparations Would Exacerbate Racism\n\nFinally, reparations if actually implemented, would almost certainly inflame racism. Americans who were not descendants of African-American slaves would see their taxes increase \u2014 or inflation if the government decided just to issue the money \u2014 as a result of the reparations. Some of them \u2014 likely many of them \u2014 would become resentful. Reparations would almost certainly cause a resurgence of racism. Where will the grievances stop if we try to repair those of generations ago at the expense of people now? It should stop with every generation. Purposefully inspiring racism is immoral.\n\nDebunking the case for reparations doesn\u2019t mean white-washing slavery; we don\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t so bad and so didn\u2019t deserve restitution. It was a horrible atrocity because human beings are not commodities; each is made in the image of God; slaves had inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that were violated. But the secret to past racial injustice is justice now, not a check. Rejecting the cries for reparations for slavery means that we don\u2019t get swept along by a cause garbed in morality that is, rather, profoundly immoral.\n\nJohn B.

Read preview\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has dazzled Democrats as the party's new presidential nominee.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden stepped aside as the presumptive nominee in July, the party quickly coalesced around her. And any concerns anyone had about her lackluster 2020 presidential campaign were largely put to rest.\n\nHer favorability rating has soared among likely voters. She quickly rallied the Democratic base and saw a bump in support among independents, which helped give her polling leads across swing states in recent weeks. And, last week, the Harris campaign announced it had raised $361 million in August alone \u2014 nearly three times the $130 million former President Donald Trump brought in that same month.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nStill, in a reminder of just how volatile American elections can be, a newly released New York Times/Siena College poll found Trump had a one-point edge over Harris among likely voters. The poll might indicate that Harris' momentum has stalled or it could be an outlier. New polls in the coming days will tell more, as will Tuesday's presidential debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is certain is that many of the complexities of the 2024 contest never went away after Biden's exit from the race. Here's why the contest remains a nail-biter at this late stage.\n\nA race within the margin of error\n\nDespite a series of polls showing Harris with advantages in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the leads are generally in the single digits and within the margin of error.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe latest Times national poll showed Trump with 48% support among likely voters, with Harris at 47% support.\n\nThe result is unchanged from the Times national survey taken in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome important figures stick out in the most recent Times poll.\n\nHarris saw majority support among voters under 45. She performed strongest among voters aged 30 to 44, winning this group by nine points (51% to 42%). Meanwhile, Trump led among Gen X and voters aged 65 and older by margins within 10 points.\n\nFor Harris, turnout among the youngest voters will be key as she seeks to win traditional swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and hold Sun Belt battlegrounds like Arizona and Nevada. Harris' appeal with young voters is a major reason she's been able to put North Carolina back into play for Democrats, which was a far cry from even three months ago when Biden struggled there.\n\nIn the Times survey, Harris also had a 10-point lead (52% to 42%) with suburban voters, a significant show of support that could make a huge difference should she extend that advantage over her GOP rival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Trump's lead in the Times survey, the former president's woes in the suburbs are perhaps one the biggest threats to his campaign, as it would likely dampen his ability to win in a critical state like Pennsylvania should Harris gain more steam closer to the election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris immediately boosted Democratic prospects across the Sun Belt when she entered the presidential race, but the overall contest remains close. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nVoters want to know more about Harris\n\nThe presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be perhaps the most critical opportunity for Harris to reach voters that remain on the fence about who they'll support at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn the Times survey, 27% of likely voters said they wanted to \"learn more\" about Harris. Meanwhile, only 9% of likely voters expressed a similar sentiment about Trump.\n\nFor the voters who indicated they wanted to learn more about Harris, nearly 7 in 10 said they wanted to hear more about the vice president's policies and plans. An additional 10% said they wanted to learn \"everything\" about Harris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, in effect, Trump boasts a slender lead against a candidate who remains a blank slate to a significant slice of the electorate.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a first step for Harris in emerging from the shadows and onto the national stage. But the debate in Philadelphia will give her time to articulate her vision for what remains the biggest issue of the election: the economy.\n\nIn the latest Times poll, Trump had a 13-point lead (55% to 42%) over Harris on who would be better equipped to handle the economy.\n\nTrump, who has relentlessly criticized Democrats over the issue, has made it a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris has begun to cut into Trump's advantage on the issue in recent weeks, which had dogged Biden as a candidate. Other surveys, including a Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll released last month, actually showed Harris with a one-point edge (42% to 41%) over Trump on economic matters among registered voters.\n\nThat close result is just another reflection of the competitive nature of the race, a dynamic that will likely remain the same until November."

Read preview\n\nJust two months out from the 2024 US presidential election, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are working to appeal to American voters on issues like the economy, culture, women's healthcare, and education, among other domestic matters.\n\nBut there's a lot going on abroad right now, and many of these problems likely aren't going away anytime soon.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nRegardless of who is elected to the highest office this fall, the next president will potentially face a wide range of international challenges \u2014 and potential crises \u2014 that may draw their attention beyond the US borders. Issues range from China and Taiwan to the Middle East to the Ukraine war.\n\nTrump's first term, and his foreign policy in particular, were marked by an \"America First\" strategy that overhauled the US role on the global stage. On a second go around, it's unclear what that continued approach would look like, although he's recently expressed some controversial opinions on NATO, how he would have handled Israel's war in Gaza, and the Ukraine war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas has been a major point of Biden's presidency, likely heavily influencing voters' opinions of Harris. Anadolu (Getty Images)\n\nHarris, on the other hand, may find international issues to be something of a hurdle. She has yet to release a platform on issues like Ukraine and Russia, China, and North Korea, and it's unclear how many, if any, of her policies will align with President Joe Biden's approach.\n\nBut either Trump or Harris will likely find foreign policy at the forefront of their presidencies as the world changes \u2014 and with some conflicts on the brink or ongoing, these are some of the biggest problems that could be awaiting whoever sits in the Oval Office next.\n\nRussia and the Ukraine war\n\nThe war in Ukraine continues on with little end in sight, and Western support has been critical for Ukraine's survival. AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka\n\nOver two and a half years in, the war in Ukraine has no immediate end in sight. Casualties are abysmal, with recent Western intelligence estimates putting Russian deaths and injuries at over 600,000. Ukrainian forces have likewise suffered high losses, though details are unclear. Ukraine shockingly invaded the Kursk region in Russia, but Russian forces in Ukraine continue advancing.\n\nAnd beyond the war itself, North Korean support for Russia, including ammunition, missiles, and other equipment, has created a concerning partnership between America's foes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS politics have often impacted how the country supports Ukraine, engages with its allies and partners on this issue, and how it confronts Russia over the conflict. These issues, like those of the war itself, continue to linger.\n\nThe US has been impactful, backing Ukraine as its largest single-nation provider of security assistance, but divisions in Congress have made sending more support difficult at times. Additionally, US flip-flopping and repeated hesitation on weapons provisions and use have often been criticized for hindering Ukraine.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTrump and Harris have expressed polar opposite views of supporting Ukraine, which adds uncertainty to Kyiv's future.\n\nTrump has said, without reason or evidence, that he'd end the Ukraine war in 24 hours and has repeatedly threatened to undermine the NATO alliance's collective defense. Harris has said she \"will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies,\" citing her efforts within the Biden administration to support Kyiv as evidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn aggressive China\n\nChina is throwing its weight around in the Indo-Pacific region, upsetting its neighbors and raising concerns about further escalation. Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nIssues in the Indo-Pacific region, especially related to China, Taiwan, and the Philippines, as well as other regional US allies, are likely to be important matters facing the next president as well.\n\nThe Pentagon has long identified this region as its primary focus, even as other conflicts around the world often pull its attention away, and all branches of the US military have stepped up training, exercises, and strategies to deter the US' pacing challenge, China.\n\nThe ongoing clashes between China and the Philippines in contested waters in the South China Sea are rooted in long-standing disputes and have the potential to escalate into conflict, which could draw the US in through its mutual defense pact.\n\nRecently, the commander of US Indo-Pacific Command even suggested it's possible the US could send ships to escort Philippine vessels to protect them from Chinese harassment, essentially putting the US in the middle of this South China Sea standoff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother potential flashpoint is a possible Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, relentlessly seeking unification. China has repeatedly stated that unification with the autonomous island nation is inevitable, even if it must be done by force. The US military has said that China aims to be ready for such a fight by 2027.\n\nBeijing's intimidation tactics, including large military exercises and constant incursions in Taiwan's waters and airspace, have raised concerns over how Beijing would use its military to force Taiwan into submission.\n\nTrump and Harris again differ on the US role in this region. Trump has shown less support for alliances, left ambiguity around US defense commitments to Taiwan, and said Taiwan should pay the US for its support. Harris has repeatedly called out China's aggressive behavior in the region and aligns with Biden on support for Taiwan.\n\nThe ongoing crises in the Middle East\n\nAlmost a year after Hamas' brutal terrorist attack in Israel, the Middle East faces continued turmoil. Amir Cohen via Reuters\n\nAnother major issue, like the war in Ukraine, is Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Hamas carried out its vicious terrorist attack inside Israel on October 7, 2023, killing over 1,000 Israelis, mostly civilians, according to Human Rights Watch, the horrors that have unfolded in the region have presented various challenges for the Biden administration.\n\nIsrael's war, which has involved bombing campaigns and ground operations, has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to estimates from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. It has also sparked increased tensions and, in some cases, outright conflicts with Iran and its proxies, often bringing the Middle East just to the brink of all-out war. There have been assassinations, missile barrages, firefights, and more.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis' attacks on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman began in response to the war but have evolved into something more over time. The US has sent forces, particularly aircraft carriers and destroyers, to the region to deter Iran and confront the Houthi rebels.\n\nEfforts to stop the Houthis have cost the US over $1 billion in weapons, including surface-to-air missiles, land-attack missiles, air-to-air missiles, and air-to-surface weapons. And that figure was just for one carrier strike group and a few extra destroyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's unclear when these conflicts will end.\n\nHarris' language on Israel and Gaza has mostly echoed Biden's: staunch support for Israel but with repeated calls for a ceasefire. But the White House's continued issues with pro-Palestinian protestors and disagreements with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are trickling into Harris' campaign.\n\nTrump showed unequivocal support for Israel in his first term and made repeated decisions that improved US-Israeli relations. He has said he supports Israel's war in Gaza and would continue to give Israel the weapons and aid it wants; he also told donors he'd \"crush\" pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nTensions with North Korea\n\nSince North Korea's failure in Hanoi at the Trump summits in 2019, the nation's trajectory has shifted upwards. STR/KCNA VIA KNS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNorth Korea has bounced back from failed negotiations with the US and the isolation of COVID, establishing new, potentially fruitful connections with Russia through arms deals. Those ties have China engaging Pyongyang as well, leaving it, as one expert said earlier this year, \"sitting pretty.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth Korea has been emboldened, setting in stone its nuclear status and continuing to advance its missile programs while notably strengthening its relationship with US rivals.\n\nAdditionally, North Korean provocations persist amid growing concerns about inter-Korean conflict, which would, as it did in the 1950s, inevitably draw in the US in response.\n\nTrump and Harris may be more aligned on their North Korean policy than other issues, but US policy with regard to North Korea has traditionally been a pitfall, with displays of force and demands for it to denuclearize often failing. Negotiations have also been unsuccessful.\n\nIn shaping US policy, the next president could also face challenges with South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol, a hawk who has taken a harsher stance on North Korea than the previous administration, requiring the delicate navigation of bilateral relations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither leader will have to navigate tension and potential for conflict across the globe. Spencer Platt and Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nBoth Trump and Harris find themselves running for president at a particular tense time in global politics. Amid a number of challenges at home, US attention is being pulled in a variety of directions.\n\nWhoever wins the 2024 presidential election this November will have to consider how to manage these issues along with the US position on the world stage. And their decisions could impact not just the US, but allies, partners, and adversaries as well."

            "headline": "Yellow weather warning issued as UK set for thundery rain",
            "text": "Heavy rain hits parts of England and Wales\n\nRichard Sellers/PA Wire Spectators brave the weather during the AJ Bell Great North Run 2024 through Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and South Shields\n\nThe Met Office has a yellow weather warning in place that covers most of southern England, and much of south and mid-Wales. Forecasters warned that spells of heavy, possibly thundery rain between 21:00 BST on Saturday and 18:00 BST on Sunday may cause flooding and disruption. However, rain and showers are expected to ease throughout Sunday evening and overnight, according to the BBC Weather Centre. By 17:00 BST on Sunday, the Environment Agency had lifted all but one flood alert for parts of England, while Natural Resources Wales removed all of their flood alerts for the country's southern regions.\n\nWarnings for flash flooding have been in place over the weekend. Senior BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry said: \"Given all the rain that has fallen recently across southern parts of the UK, this could result in some localised flash-flooding,\" \"However, some parts of the warning area may see little or no rainfall at all.\" It comes as people had to be rescued in parts of south Wales on Saturday, with a couple helped from their car as roads flooded following heavy rain. Another person was rescued by firefighters after their home was flooded in Bridgend.\n\nMet Office All of southern England, except the western tip of Cornwall, is covered by the warning\n\nBBC Wales senior meteorologist Derek Brockway said a month's rain fell in 24 hours at Swansea's Victoria Park on Friday - which became the UK's wettest place. Some parts of south-east England also had more than half of their expected rainfall for the whole of September in 24 hours on Thursday and Friday. Goudhurst in Kent and Farnham in Surrey saw 29.4mm (1.16 inches) and 28.4mm (1.12 inches) respectively. Sunday's yellow warning for rain covers all of southern and central England up to South Yorkshire, and all of Wales' southern counties. The Met Office said areas of heavy and thundery rain over the weekend were expected to spread north, and then west, across England and Wales. These areas of heavy rain may become more persistent across western areas during Sunday daytime, while slow-moving heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to develop further east, the Met Office said. There is a low chance that a few spots within the warning area could see 80 to100mm (3.1 inches to 3.9 inches) of rain by the end of Sunday. These higher totals are slightly more probable in the southern half of the warning area.\n\nBailey Moules A road near Cooden Beach railway station in Bexhill was flooded on Thursday\n\nFrom Saturday evening there was heavy and thundery rain which cleared northwards across some southern parts of the UK overnight, according to the Met Office. Some of the more persistent rain has been affecting Wales, parts of the West Midlands and northern England, with Victoria Park in Swansea gaining further 38mm (1.4 inches) of rain overnight into Sunday. There has also been heavy rainfall in parts of Shropshire. Close to Shrewsbury, 47mm (1.8 inches) of rain has fallen so far since Sunday morning. The figure is well over half the September rainfall average of around 61mm (2.4 inches) for the region, according to the BBC Weather Centre. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Harris said: \"Reminiscent of this time last week, the forecast for later this weekend comes with larger uncertainties than average. \"This is due to a more complex than usual meteorological pattern involving multiple corridors of heavy, locally thundery rain revolving around a slow-moving area of low pressure.\" Mr Harris added that people should keep up-to-date with weather forecasts as warnings will be kept under review.\n\nReuters Motoring enthusiasts shield from the heavy downpours as they attend the Goodwood Revival, a three-day historic car racing festival near Chichester\n\nWhat about next week?\n\n\"The rain and showers will ease through this evening and overnight as low pressure responsible slides away to the east,\" BBC Weather Centre Meteorologist Gareth Harvey said. \"An Atlantic low pressure system will bring some rain to the north of the UK going through Monday into Monday night. This clears to the south and east during Tuesday, ushering in much cooler air to the whole of the UK,\" he added. However, he warned that showers \"will be plentiful around the middle of the week, especially so towards the north-west\", with the air potentially \"cold enough for some snowfall mixed in with some of the showers over the highest Scottish mountain peaks\".\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

            "headline": "Dick Cheney Reveals His Reason for Endorsing Kamala Harris Over Donald Trump",
            "text": "Former Vice President and influential Republican Dick Cheney released a statement announcing his endorsement of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Speaking out against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, Cheney said that he can \u201cnever be trusted with power again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our nation\u2019s 248 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\u201d Cheney, 83, said in the statement shared on Sept. 6. \u201cHe tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,\u201d he continued, referencing the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nCheney, who served as Vice President under President George W. Bush between 2001 and 2009 went on to say that American citizens have a \u201cduty\u201d to prioritize the nation over partisan politics.\n\nThe statement came Friday, hours after one of Cheney\u2019s daughters, former Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney revealed on a panel at the Texas Tribune\u2019s annual festival that her father will be voting for Harris.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the moment we\u2019re in, and you think about how serious this moment is, my dad believes\u2014and he said publicly\u2014there has never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,\u201d she had said on the panel moderated by journalist Mark Leibovich.\n\nCheney\u2019s endorsement marks the most high profile Republican politician to announce that they will vote for Harris over Republican nominee Trump, further spotlighting other former establishment Republicans who have yet to come out to endorse Trump during this run for the presidency\u2014many of whom have been critical of Trump in the past\u2014including his own former Vice President Mike Pence, former President George W. Bush, and former Republican nominee for President Mitt Romney.\n\nThe Harris campaign responded in a statement on Friday, supporting the endorsement.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President is proud to have the support of Vice-President Cheney, and deeply respects his courage to put country over party,\u201d said campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon.\n\nHarris was asked about the Cheneys\u2019 endorsement while on the campaign trail, visiting a spice shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She said she was \u201chonored\u201d to have their endorsement, and that it represented the opportunity to \u201cturn the page\u201d on partisan divisiveness.\n\n\u201cA lot of what I think is happening, and I was just talking with some folks here in Pittsburgh about it, is that people are exhausted about the division and the attempts to kind of divide us as Americans,\u201d Harris told reporters. \u201cAnd, them stepping up to make this public statement, I think, is courageous.\u201d\n\nTrump reacted to Cheney\u2019s statement via a post shared on his own social media platform, Truth Social. He called the former Vice President an \u201cirrelevant RINO\u201d\u2014 which stands for Republican in Name Only and is a term used by some to describe Republicans who are viewed as being disloyal to the party.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris. I am the Peace President, and only I will stop World War III!,\u201d Trump wrote on Sept. 6.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday, Sept. 8, Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders appeared on NBC's Meet the Press, where he was asked by host Kristen Welker about the Cheneys' support of Harris. \"What I think Dick and Liz Cheney are saying is that in this existential moment in American history, it's not just issues,\" Sanders said. \"Cheney and I agree on nothing, no issues. But what we do believe in is that the United States should retain its democratic foundations.\"\n\n\n\nHe went on to add: \"I applaud the Cheneys for their courage in defending democracy. Obviously, on all the issues we have very different points of view.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, ahead of her father's statement, Liz Cheney herself publicly supported Harris, announcing her endorsement for the Democratic nominee. \u201cAs a conservative and someone who believes in and cares deeply about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses\u2014not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\u201d she said on Sept. 4 at a Sanford School of Public Policy event at Duke University in North Carolina.\n\nThe former Wyoming representative was ostracized by Trump-backed Republicans after she sat as one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over allegations that he incited the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021."

            "headline": "Harris and Trump Are Getting Ready for Tuesday\u2019s Debate in Sharply Different Ways",
            "text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are veering sharply in how they gear up for Tuesday's presidential debate, setting up a showdown that reflects not just two separate visions for the country but two politicians who approach big moments very differently.\n\nThe vice president is cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh where she can focus on honing crisp two-minute answers, per the debate's rules. She's been working with aides since Thursday and chose a venue that allows the Democratic nominee the option of mingling with swing-state voters.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, publicly dismisses the value of studying for the debate. The former president is choosing instead to fill his days with campaign-related events on the premise that he'll know what he needs to do once he steps on the debate stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cYou can go in with all the strategy you want but you have to sort of feel it out as the debate\u2019s taking place,\u201d he said during a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nTrump then quoted former boxing great Mike Tyson, who said, \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.\u201d\n\nHarris has said she is prepared for Trump to rattle off insults and misrepresent facts, even as her campaign has seen value in focusing on the middle class and the prospects of a better future for the country.\n\n\u201cWe should be prepared for the fact that he is not burdened by telling the truth,\u201d Harris said in a radio interview for the Rickey Smiley Morning Show. \u201cHe tends to fight for himself, not for the American people, and I think that\u2019s going to come out during the course of the debate.\"\n\nIn her own preparation, Harris has the Democratic consultant Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, portraying Trump. She likes to describe Trump as having a \u201cplaybook\u201d of falsehoods to go after Democrats such as Clinton and former President Barack Obama.\n\nHarris has said she understands Trump on a deeper psychological level. She has tried in speeches like her remarks at the Democratic National Convention to show that she would be a stronger leader than him \u2014 an argument that gets at Trump's own desire to project and show strength.\n\nTrump's June 27 debate against President Joe Biden shook up the election, with Biden's disastrous performance ultimately leading to him stepping aside as the Democratic nominee and endorsing Harris. Both campaigns know the first in-person meeting between Harris and Trump could be a decisive event in a tight race.\n\nTrump is preemptively criticizing the ABC News debate moderators, claiming he will not be treated fairly. But he said he plans to let Harris speak, just as he did during his debate with Biden.\n\n\u201cI let him talk. I\u2019m gonna let her talk,\u201d he said during the Hannity town hall.\n\nTrump aides said that this time would be no different than the previous debate and that the former president would not be doing any more traditional prep. There are no stand-ins, no sets, no play-acting.\n\nInstead, they point to Trump\u2019s frequent interviews, including taking questions at lengthy press conferences, sitting for hourlong podcasts, and participating in town halls with friendly hosts like Hannity.\n\nTrump also meets regularly with policy advisers who are experts on issues that may come up during the debate. During these informal sessions, they talk about the issues, Trump\u2019s policies while he was in office, and the plans he\u2019s put forth for a second term.\n\n\u201cI have meetings on it. We talk about it. But there\u2019s not a lot you can do. You either know your subject or not. You either have good policy or not,\u201d he said in a New Hampshire radio interview.\n\nBefore the last debate Trump held sessions with notable Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who at the time was under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick. This time he has held sessions with Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate who is now backing Trump.\n\nGabbard, who is also now a member of Trump\u2019s transition team, was brought in specifically to help Trump this time around because she knows Harris, having debated her when the two were running for the Democratic nomination in 2020. She also hosted a recent town hall with Trump in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump, aides insist, intends to put Harris on the defensive. He wants to portray her as too liberal as he tries to tie her to Biden\u2019s economic record and points out her reversals on issues such as a fracking ban that she no longer supports.\n\n\u201cWe look forward for the opportunity for Americans to see her on stage, incapable of defending her policies and flip-flops,\u201d said Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. \u201cThe president\u2019s proven he has a command of the issues, she does not.\u201d\n\nHarris' team is banking that Trump will come off as extreme and that they can use the debate as a springboard to further build on the momentum that her short campaign has generated. The campaign plans to use the pre-debate weekend to hold 2,000 events with volunteers and reach more than one million voters.\n\n\u201cWith hundreds of offices and thousands of staff across the battlegrounds, we are able to harness all the buzz around the debate and break through to hard-to-reach voters,\u201d said Dan Kanninen, the campaign's battleground states director, in a statement."

Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\"\n\nTrump's message represents his latest threat to use the office of the presidency to exact retribution if he wins a second term. There is no evidence of the kind of fraud he continues to insist marred the 2020 election; in fact, dozens of courts, Republican state officials and his own administration have said he lost fairly.\n\nJust days ago, Trump himself acknowledged in a podcast interview that he had indeed \u201clost by a whisker.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump's campaign aides and allies have urged him to keep his focus on Harris and make the election a referendum on issues like inflation and border security, Trump in recent days has veered far off course.\n\nOn Friday, he delivered a stunning statement to news cameras in which he brought up a string of past allegations of sexual misconduct, describing several in graphic detail, even as he denied his accusers\u2019 allegations. Earlier, he had voluntarily appeared in court for a hearing on the appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, turning focus to his legal woes in the campaign's final stretch.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Trump had leaned into familiar grievances about everything from his indictments to Russia's meddling in the 2016 election as he campaigned in one of the most deeply Republican swaths of battleground Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cThe Harris-Biden DOJ is trying to throw me in jail \u2014 they want me in jail \u2014 for the crime of exposing their corruption,\u201d Trump claimed at an outdoor rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, where he spoke behind a wall of bulletproof glass due to new security protocols following his July assassination attempt.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that President Joe Biden or Harris have had any influence over decisions by the Justice Department or state prosecutors to indict the former president.\n\nTrump has eschewed traditional debate preparation, choosing to hold rallies and events while Harris has been cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, working with aides since Thursday.\n\nHarris has agreed so far to a single debate, which will be hosted by ABC.\n\nAt the rally, Trump outlined his plans to \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d \u2014 a throwback to his winning 2016 campaign message as he ran as an outsider challenging the status quo. Though Trump spent four years in the Oval Office, he vowed anew to \u201ccast out the corrupt political class\u201d if he wins again and to \u201ccut the fat out of our government for the first time, meaningfully, in 60 years.\u201d\n\nAs part of that effort, he repeated his plan, announced Thursday, to create a new \u201cGovernment Efficiency Commission\u201d headed by Elon Musk that will be charged with conducting \u201ca complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government\" to root out waste.\n\nAfter again maligning the Congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the nation\u2019s capitol by his supporters after his election loss in 2020, Trump told the crowd of thousands that he would \u201crapidly review the cases of every political prisoner unjustly victimized by the Harris regime\u201d and sign their pardons on his first day back in office.\n\nTrump has repeatedly defended those who have been jailed for crimes including violent attacks on law enforcement.\n\nAnd he said he would \u201ccompletely overhaul\u201d what he labeled \u201cKamala\u2019s corrupt Department of Injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of persecuting Republicans, they will focus on taking down bloodthirsty cartels, transnational gangs, and radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika responded to his comments with a statement warning that, if Trump is reelected, he will \u201cuse his unchecked power to prosecute his enemies and pardon insurrectionists who violently attacked our Capitol on January 6.\"\n\nBoth Harris and Trump have been frequent visitors to Wisconsin this year, a state where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point. Several polls of Wisconsin voters conducted after Biden withdrew showed Harris and Trump in a close race.\n\nDemocrats consider Wisconsin to be one of the must-win \u201cblue wall\u201d states. Biden, who was in Wisconsin on Thursday, won the state in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes. Trump carried it by a slightly larger margin, nearly 23,000 votes, in 2016.\n\nAs Trump was campaigning, Harris took a short break from debate prep to visit Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, where she bought several seasoning mixes. One customer saw the Democratic nominee and began openly weeping as Harris hugged her and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nHarris said she was honored to have endorsements from two major Republicans: former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman.\n\n\u201cPeople are exhausted, about the division and the attempts to kind of divide us as Americans,\u201d she said, adding that her main message at the debate would be that the country wants to be united.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the page on the divisiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring our country together, to chart a new way forward.\u201d\n\nTrump held his rally in the central Wisconsin city of Mosinee, with a population of about 4,500 people. It is within Wisconsin's mostly rural 7th Congressional District, a reliably Republican area in a purple state.\n\nDuring his speech, he railed against Harris in dark and ominous language, claiming that if the woman he calls \u201cComrade Kamala Harris gets four more years, you will be living (in) a full-blown Banana Republic\" ruled by \u201canarchy\u201d and \u201ctyranny.\u201d\n\nTrump also railed against the administration's border policies, calling the Democrats\u2019 approach \u201csuicidal\" and accusing them of having \u201cimported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet.\"\n\nMany studies have found immigrants, including those in the country illegally, commit fewer violent crimes than native-born citizens. Violent crime in the U.S. dropped again last year, continuing a downward trend after a pandemic-era spike.\n\nHe dismissed warnings from U.S. officials about ongoing Russian attempts to spread disinformation ahead of November's election, including an indictment this past week that alleged a media company linked to six conservative influencers was secretly funded by Russian state media employees.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department said Russia may be involved in our elections again,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd, you know, the whole world laughed at it this time.\u201d\n\nAmong those in the crowd was Dale Osuldsen, who was celebrating his 68th birthday Saturday at his first ever Trump rally. He hopes a second Trump administration will take on \u201ccancel culture\u201d and bring the country back to its \u201cfoundational past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had past administrations say they want to fundamentally change America,\u201d Osulden said. \u201cFundamentally changing America is a bad thing.\u201d\n\nMany supporters embarked on hours-long drives from across Wisconsin to see Trump speak. Some came from even further.\n\nSean Moon, a Tennessee musician who releases MAGA-themed rap music under the stage name, \u201cKing Bullethead,\u201d blasted his songs from a truck in the event parking lot. As a musician, he said Trump rallies approximate the experience of a raucous concert.\n\n\u201cTrump is a rockstar,\u201d Moon said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredible. People see he represents them and the deep state trying to kill him and take him out. But he\u2019s standing strong, and he stands for the normal person.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have relied on massive turnout in the state's two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, to counter Republican strength in rural areas like Mosinee and the Milwaukee suburbs. Trump must win the votes in places like Mosinee to have any chance of cutting into the Democrats' advantage in urban areas.\n\nRepublicans held their national convention in Milwaukee in July and Trump has made four previous stops to the state, most recently just last week in the western Wisconsin city of La Crosse.\n\nHarris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last month filled the same Milwaukee arena where Republicans held their national convention for a rally that coincided with the Democratic National Convention just 90 miles away in Chicago. Walz returned Monday to Milwaukee, where he spoke at a Labor Day rally organized by unions."

            "headline": "How Kamala Harris Can Beat Donald Trump in the Debate",
            "text": "In Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1945 film Spellbound, Ingrid Bergman plays a psychiatrist who has fallen in love with her patient, an amnesiac accused of murder. Desperate to restore his memory and prove his innocence, she brings him to her own analyst for emergency psychoanalysis, hoping a single session can restore the patient to reality. \u201cI want you to look on me like your father,\u201d the analyst tells him, \u201cTrust me. Lean on me. It\u2019s a shortcut, but we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris doesn\u2019t have much time. She emerged from the Democratic National Convention on a roll, fueled by America\u2019s desperate need to find a parent figure who can be trusted to bring the American people back to reality. Much of the country seems to be freshly excited by Harris\u2019 campaign of joy and inclusion, and tired of the politics of division and character assassination. The question is, will the momentum accompanying the Harris-Walz love parade last through Election Day?\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to be fearful that Harris\u2019 recent trajectory will trigger a backlash. Sigmund Freud warned that the \u201cpositive transference\u201d that comes at the start of therapy can be short-lived. The same is true of the positive regard that follows a political convention. The pendulum, Freud warned, can easily swing back to \u201cnegative\u201d transference, even outright hostility, if the patient\u2019s anxieties are brought into awareness without the assurance that the therapist has the goodwill and capacity to see the process through. It\u2019s at these very junctures that the archetypes of the unconscious can do their greatest mischief, shifting what at one moment is experienced as a benevolent parent into a duplicitous one. Harris has come away from the convention with the opportunity to be America\u2019s therapist, to bring the country together to face our very real challenges, but the cultural unconscious is impatient; she has a very short timeline in which to demonstrate to Americans that she is up to the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow this will play out in the remaining weeks of the current election cycle will depend on each candidate\u2019s political instincts, as well as their ability to take control of the psychological narrative as it unfolds beneath the surface.\n\nThese instincts will be on full display in the first debate this week, when Harris and Trump each vie for America\u2019s conscious and unconscious support. Tens of millions of Americans will be watching to see if Harris can maintain the positive regard she has generated, or whether she will become just another Democrat steamrolled under the Trump juggernaut. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\n\nWhether we admit it or not, all of America has been excited by the fact that Donald Trump has rewritten the rules of debating, just as he has rewritten the rules of politics. Thrilled or horrified, we know Trump has made the debates a form of entertainment: part gladiator arena, where aggression, charisma, impulse, and spectacle matter more than policy, integrity, reason, and information, and part adolescent playground, where the bully is king and adults are not welcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Harris is to fulfill her mandate to bring America back to reality, she must first and foremost find a way to stand apart from the Trumpian circus. The challenge is simple, but difficult: She must deny Trump the pleasure of his aggression by being immune to his weaponry. She must refuse him the attention he craves. She managed this instinctively in her CNN interview, when asked about Trump\u2019s racist goading: \u201cSame old tired playbook. Next question.\u201d That deft sidestepping of the Trump attack worked because it exposed the vulnerability inherent in Trump\u2019s psychological makeup, the narcissist\u2019s one Achilles\u2019 heel: Narcissists cannot tolerate being ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut managing Trump in his absence is one thing; ignoring his formidable presence once they are both in the ring will be quite another. Harris must use the skills honed as a prosecutor while never giving up the no-nonsense-but-compassionate maternal archetype she now embodies for the American people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo decisively win the debate, Harris must do more than dance around Trump; she must demonstrate to the American people that the Trumpian archetype\u2014the impulsive narcissistic bully who promises protection in exchange for absolute fealty\u2014is a faux solution for what is in fact a very real problem: the fact that so many hardworking people in America feel isolated, overlooked, and powerless. Harris\u2019 task is to acknowledge the struggles of the American working class while making plain that Trump\u2019s bullying is itself a symptom of the American illness; it is an attempt to use aggression, suspicion, and blame to defend against the hopelessness and isolation that are epidemic among a certain class of Americans.\n\nTrump has capitalized on this sense of isolation by mobilizing in his followers the most primitive psychological beliefs about loss and loneliness: what Freud called the \u201csibling complex,\u201d the unconscious belief that the parents\u2019 love and attention, once exclusively the child\u2019s, has been unjustly taken away and given to a preferred sibling. In the Trumpian archetype, the preferred sibling is the newborn, the unwelcome intruder into what had been an ideal family constellation. For Trump and his followers, the American epidemic of loneliness is seen to be the result of unworthy interlopers who unjustly monopolize parental attention: DEI hires, affirmative action recipients, immigrants given asylum, etc.; Trump asserts that these are \u201ccrybabies\u201d whose pretend suffering has replaced the true suffering of his favorite children. Make America Great Again is psychological code for Trump\u2019s promise to rid the family of the crybabies and restore to his chosen children the fantasied status of being the favored child once again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom a psychological point of view, Democrats have done exactly the same thing, only for them, a different sibling archetype is at play. For Democrats, the unconscious sibling rivalry is the envy of the privileges of the firstborn son. The oppressed, psychologically, are the overlooked younger siblings, the new arrivals, slighted by the privilege traditionally accorded to firstborn males. In the Democratic narrative, we are a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d but the immigrants are the ones who struggle. The Democratic narrative has become one which mobilizes the resentment of the vulnerable siblings\u2014women, racial and gender minorities, migrants\u2014against the privileged ones for whom wealth and power are seen as having been unfairly inherited\u2014heterosexual white males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn effect, leaders of both parties have been playing to these divisive primitive archetypes, where the competition for the position of the truly suffering child versus the child who benefits unfairly contributes to a pathological political discourse of polarization, aggression, and moralism. And, as a result, both parties have struggled to acknowledge the American reality\u2014that America\u2019s suffering is in fact unequally distributed, but not primarily along gender and racial lines (those play a role, of course, in what Michelle Obama has called the \u201caffirmative action of wealth\u201d). More importantly and more centrally, though, America\u2019s suffering is experienced along economic lines, foremost by the working and less-educated classes who make up the majority of the country. This suffering cuts across racial, ethnic, and gender divisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the parent\u2019s job, as it is the true political leader\u2019s job, to offer an alternative to the infantile animosities that emerge in hard times. The healthy response to the child\u2019s feeling of loneliness and isolation is for the parent not to play favorites, but to show love for her children equally, even if she responds to them differentially according to their needs. Freud believed that such parenting is not only the basis for a healthy family, it is also the foundation of civilization; the origin of the ideal of equal justice under the law is derived in part from overcoming primitive sibling hostility.\n\nIf Kamala Harris is to bring America back to reality, she must make use of the positive transference currently on offer to her and declare herself the person to help all struggling Americans. In her speeches, she is already there. To the surprise of people on both sides of the aisle, Harris refuses to focus on her gender or her race, and she is clear that her campaign is not about what divides, but about what unites: \u201cThe true measure of strength is not based on who you beat down, but who you lift up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf history is a guide, Trump will attack Harris out of the gate at the debate. His strategy will be to offer the American people the narcissistic bully\u2019s cure for loneliness and isolation: to draw the blood of his adversary and invite the crowd to join him in that sadistic pleasure.\n\nRelated From Slate How Kamala Harris Defeated the Vibecession Read More\n\nHarris, fortunately, has exactly the personality to deny Trump this connection. She has mastered the art of turning her adversary\u2019s aggression to her advantage. When Trump attacks, rather than correcting him, or even acknowledging him, she should simply offer the audience what her husband calls \u201cthat look\u201d\u2014a look that indicates simply that this isn\u2019t the way to behave in the world. If Trump tries to stalk her as he stalked Hillary Clinton, it is easy to imagine Harris responding with exasperation: \u201cDonald, stop acting like a bully and go back to your podium.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, apparently, is what the country is lacking in its leadership: A parent who loves her children equally, and wants the best for them, but also knows that it is in the children\u2019s interest to be corrected when they get out of line.\n\nDonald Trump is right when he speaks to the problems of working people, of middle-Americans in swing states who have lost their identities and feel isolated and powerless. Harris\u2019 job is to recognize the struggles of those Americans and all working Americans. She needs to bring America into emergency therapy, to lift up and not beat down, unite and not separate. And if, to accomplish that, she draws on the trust that Americans unconsciously give to the fair-but-tough mother, so be it. \u201cIt\u2019s a shortcut, but we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d"

            "headline": "GOP probe details deadly Afghanistan withdrawal, finds no direct role by Harris",
            "text": "House Republicans on Monday released the results of a sweeping three-year investigation they say is the most detailed public accounting yet of the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that left behind hundreds of Americans and thousands of allies, some so desperate they clung to U.S. planes as the last military aircraft departed Kabul in 2021.\n\nThe report by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul -- which relied on interviews with 18 top officials and 20,000 pages of documents -- blames the White House, its National Security Council and the State Department for being slow to listen to military generals who warned the security situation would deteriorate quickly once U.S. troops began to depart.\n\nThe investigation did not, however, find evidence that Vice President Kamala Harris played any role in the planning or execution of the evacuation, although she expressed public support for President Joe Biden's decision at the time.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and other Republicans have suggested Harris is culpable, noting past comments by the vice president that she was the \"last person in the room\" when Biden decided to leave Afghanistan.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, with Vice President Kamala Harris, responds to questions about the ongoing US military evacuations of US citizens and vulnerable Afghans, in Washington, DC, Aug. 20, 2021. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world,\" Trump told National Guard members and their families in Detroit last month on the anniversary of the 2021 suicide bombing at Kabul's airport during the evacuation, which killed 13 U.S. service members and some 170 Afghans.\n\nThe Biden administration pushed back on the findings by Republicans, calling it a partisan effort that sought to cherry-pick facts ahead of an election.\n\nThe Republican probe also is being released ahead of the first political debate between Harris and Trump, which ABC News is hosting on Tuesday night in Philadelphia. Trump and GOP loyalists are expected to hammer the Democratic administration for failing to prepare for a Taliban takeover once U.S. troops began to depart.\n\n\"The chaos and devastation that took place in August of 2021 has forever damaged U.S. credibility in the eyes of our allies, while emboldening our adversaries like China, Russia and Iran,\" said McCaul, R-Texas. \"Yet, not a single person was fired and, to this day, no one was ever held accountable by President Biden or Vice President Harris.\"\n\nFuneral services are held for Marine Lance Cpt. Kareem Grant Nikoui, one of 13 military personal killed during a suicide bomb attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 26th, in Riverside, Calif., Sep. 18, 2021. Barbara Davidson/Getty Images\n\nLast week, McCaul issued a subpoena for Secretary of State Antony Blinken's testimony on the withdrawal, threatening to hold him in contempt if he doesn't testify on Sept. 19. In a written statement, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller noted that Blinken has already testified on Afghanistan and the State Department provided the 20,000 pages of documents the committee was relying on to inform its investigation.\n\n\"Though the secretary is currently unavailable to testify on dates proposed by the committee, the State Department has proposed reasonable alternatives to comply with Chairman McCaul's request for a public hearing,\" Miller said. \"It is disappointing that instead of continuing to engage with the Department in good faith, the committee instead has issued yet another unnecessary subpoena.\"\n\nOn the investigation, Miller accused Republicans of politicizing the war and \"presenting inaccurate narratives.\"\n\n\"The State Department remains immensely proud of its workforce who put themselves forward in the waning days of our presence in Afghanistan to evacuate both Americans and the brave Afghans who stood by our sides for more than two decades,\" he said.\n\nWhile many of the details included in the Republican investigation have already become public through media reports and internal government reviews, among the more interesting details come from inside-the-room accounts of U.S. Embassy personnel.\n\nAt one point, according to Republicans, staff grew so panicked at the rushed evacuation that they began filling Tupperware containers with passports and visa foils to burn as Taliban forces arrived outside their building. Classified documents were eventually left behind in the scramble, according to the report, although the report doesn't say how many or what type.\n\nMeanwhile, the NSC was slow to establish criteria for who was eligible for evacuation, a standard the report says changed hourly. At one point, electronic visa letters known as \"hall passes\" were given to eligible Afghans, but the documents were so easily replicated that bootleg copies began circulating and the U.S. quickly scrapped the plan, according to the report.\n\nThe report also paints a picture of a State Department and NSC slow to understand the danger U.S. personnel were in as the Afghanistan government collapsed and the Taliban took control.\n\nAmbassador Ross Wilson, who was brought out of retirement in the Trump administration to serve in Afghanistan and was the top American diplomat in Kabul at the time of the withdrawal, was allegedly reluctant to trigger a military-led evacuation, according to the report. Wilson has spoken publicly before that his staff worked feverishly in those final days to try to process as many travel documents as possible to help qualified people evacuate.\n\nBiden has defended the State Department's handling of the evacuation in the wake of the operation.\n\n\"In the 17 days that we operated in Kabul after the Taliban seized power, we engaged in an around-the-clock effort to provide every American the opportunity to leave. Our State Department was working 24/7 contacting and talking, and in some cases, walking Americans into the airport,\" Biden said in 2021 in the wake of the withdrawal.\n\nBiden and other Democrats have also defended the decision to pull out U.S. troops and shutter the embassy after 20 years in the country, saying their options were limited after Trump struck a deal with the Taliban to depart by May 1, 2021.\n\nTrump's agreement with the Taliban included the departure of U.S. troops and the release of 5,000 Taliban fighters from Afghan prisons so long as the Taliban promised not to collaborate with al-Qaeda or engage in \"high-profile\" attacks.\n\nWanting to bring an end to the war and concerned that Taliban fighters might target American service members if the U.S. reneged on the deal, the Biden administration stayed the course but amended the U.S. withdrawal deadline to Aug. 31, 2021.\n\nThis handout image shows U.S. Soldiers and Marines assist with security at an Evacuation Control Checkpoint during an evacuation at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, Aug. 19, 2021.

The enemy occupied Kabul, the overthrow of the government occurred and the military we supported for two decades faded away,\" Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time of the withdrawal, testified last March.\n\n\"That is a strategic failure,\" he said.\n\nABC News' Emily Chang, Matthew Seyler and Shannon Kingston contributed to this report."

            "headline": "Cheney endorsement tests just how many Republican votes Harris can get",
            "text": "Will her move open the door to more Republicans doing the same?\n\nBig-name Republican endorsers of Vice President Kamala Harris are testing just how many disgruntled GOP voters are up for grabs in her race against a polarizing former President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of pre-Trump GOP royalty, became the latest and most prominent Republican to back Harris Wednesday. Harris also has endorsements from former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and hundreds of local Republican officials to try to puncture what her campaign views as Trump's soft underbelly with Republican voters who are uncomfortable with the former president's brash and unorthodox brand of politics.\n\nThe campaign's consistent outreach is just one part of Harris' overall path to Election Day, but now, with no bigger names left on the table for support, the vice president will likely find out if there's more support to be had from dissatisfied Republicans -- or if she's already maxed out.\n\nThe ABC News presidential debate will take place on Sept. 10 at 9 p.m. ET and air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n\"The Kinzinger/Cheney endorsements are designed by Democrats to make Republican voters who are alienated by Trump's dishonesty, bad character, felony conviction, public policy ignorance, etc., feel better about not just abstaining but actively showing their displeasure by voting for Harris,\" said former Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., a conservative six-term lawmaker who clashed with Trump during his 2022 Senate race.\n\n\"The number of Republican voters swayed by Republicans who endorse Harris is relatively small,\" he added. \"But in an otherwise close race, it could be the difference between winning and losing.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Rep.

Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nCheney, a rising star in yesteryear's GOP who became both an outcast and the face of the anti-Trump Republican flank after the Jan. 6 insurrection, said Wednesday in red-leaning North Carolina that she would back Harris out of fear for American democracy. On Friday, she said her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, would do the same.\n\n\"I felt that it was a particularly important discussion to have for the first time in North Carolina, where, you know, one of the questions that that I hear from Republicans who know that they would not support Donald Trump again, but, you know, have sort of said, well, maybe I'll just write someone in, \" she said on Friday. \"And I think that, particularly when we're talking about states where we know it's going to be close, where the election will be decided, we don't have that luxury and I think it's really important to recognize the nature of the choice that we have,\" she said.\n\nThe endorsement is just one part of Harris' strategy to win over fence-sitting Republican voters.\n\nAdam Kinzinger, former Rep. (R-IL) takes the stage on Day 4 of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Aug. 22, 2024. Kevin Wurm/Reuters\n\nThe party sees an opening for expansion with wayward Republicans, particularly after hundreds of thousands of voters bucked Trump in the GOP primary to vote for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, including after she ended her campaign. And Trump has demonstrated little appetite for those who opposed him, saying at a town hall Thursday, \"I don't want that person\" when asked about people who didn't cast a primary ballot for him.\n\nDemocrats had a parade of Republican speakers, including Kinzinger, speak at their convention last month. Harris has said she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet. A network of local officials and former Trump administration officials have hit the trail to stump for Harris. And the campaign has dumped millions of dollars in advertising to suggest to Republicans that they have a place in the modern Democratic Party.\n\nTo be certain, Harris is not putting Republican converts at the heart of her strategy, recognizing the limited opportunity challenging a GOP largely in Trump's thrall. But Democrats insist that winning over a sliver of protest voters can pay dividends -- and that big names like Cheney and Kinzinger could provide a permission structure for some Republicans to punch their ticket for a Democrat this November.\n\n\"We know that there are a number of Republicans who are in a similar situation. They're not never Trump, necessarily. Some may be, but they may not know how they feel yet about Vice President Harris,\" said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. \"This kind of endorsement sends a signal to those voters that there is someone else who is high profile, but who thinks like they do about Trump and has similar concerns, and who they respect.\"\n\nIt's unclear precisely how much Cheney will be out on the trail converting Republicans, but there is already a playbook for how she can throw her weight around.\n\nIn 2022, she put $500,000 into an Arizona ad hammering Kari Lake and Mark Finchem, the Republican candidates for governor and secretary of state and vocal election deniers, saying that \"I don't know that I have ever voted for a Democrat, but if I lived in Arizona, I absolutely would.\"\n\nBoth Lake and Finchem went on to lose their races.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump speaks during a Fox News town hall hosted by Sean Hannity in Harrisburg, Pa., Sept. 4, 2024. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\nBut statewide races in a midterm year are not the same as a historic presidential election with a Republican candidate who sucks up an unparalleled amount of political oxygen.\n\nPolling has shown Harris stuck in the single digits with support among Republicans, and Trump has been a public figure for years, including nearly 10 since he launched his first campaign, leaving perceptions about him cemented enough to withstand the new endorsements.\n\n\"My instinct is that those [Republicans] and [independents] aren't moved by that -- they are already on board with Harris,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a strategist in Arizona who left the GOP in the Trump era.\n\n\"Anyone who is already voting against Trump because they hate Trump is already there, GOP pollster Robert Blizzard agreed. \"They aren't moving against him because a random former congressman says they are too.\"\n\nOther Republicans said voters might not be persuaded by Cheney and Kinzinger's dire warnings about the threat Trump poses to democracy given that, despite the three-year-old Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, guardrails held.\n\n\"I think Kinzinger and Cheney aren't that persuasive to fence sitting or 'Haley' voters. They typically do not accept the apocalyptic framing they use that Democracy ends with Trump. I think the most persuasive are those that worked with him like [Jon] Kelly, [Mark] Esper, [Henry] McMaster, [John] Bolton etc. who can say they worked with him and he's unfit,\" said anti-Trump GOP strategist Rob Stutzman, referencing former Trump administration officials with national security backgrounds.\n\nAnd with all the work and money Harris has already put into appealing to Republicans, some operatives speculated that the vice president's ceiling on GOP support may have already been met.\n\n\"It certainly helps. But I'm not sure their endorsements are leading indicators of the Never Trump movement, instead they seem more to be lagging indicators of the movement,\" said former Florida Rep. David Jolly, who left the GOP over disagreements with Trump. \"The real catalyst to the strengthening coalition has been Harris herself.\"\n\nTrump's campaign, for its part, appeared unconcerned about the recent Cheney endorsements.\n\nWhen asked what the campaign thought of Cheney announcing she and her father would vote for Harris, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung replied, \"who the f--- is Liz Cheney?\"\n\nABC News' Isabella Murray contributed to this report."

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a once-rising star in the GOP who fell out with her party over her criticism of Donald Trump, slammed the former president as an \"unrecoverable catastrophe\" in her call for other Republicans to vote against him this year.\n\n\"We see it on a daily basis, somebody who was willing to use violence in order to attempt to seize power, to stay in power, someone who represents unrecoverable catastrophe, frankly, in my view, and we have to do everything possible to ensure that he's not reelected,\" Cheney told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.\n\n\"You have many Republicans out there who are saying, 'Well, you know, we're not going to vote for him, but we will write someone else in.' And I think that this time around, that's not enough, that it's important to actually cast a vote for Vice President Harris,\" Cheney added.\n\nCheney made her endorsement of Harris official this week, also announcing her father, former Vice President and liberal antagonist Dick Cheney, would follow suit.\n\nLiz Cheney appears on \"This Week,\" Sep. 8, 2024. ABC News\n\nThe announcements from the Cheneys marked the highest profile endorsements from Republicans for Harris yet as the vice president looks to peel off disgruntled GOP voters frustrated with Trump's hardline and personal brand of politics.\n\nFor his part, Trump appeared unconcerned with the endorsements, calling the former vice president \u201can irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter,\u201d on his Truth Social platform. \"RINO\" stands for \u201cRepublican in name only.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded in kind when asked about the endorsements, replying, \"who the f--- is Liz Cheney?\"\n\nLiz Cheney cited both Harris' policy stances this year -- some of which have moved to the center since her first run in 2019 -- and a speech Harris gave at the Democratic convention this summer which leaned heavily on themes of patriotism.\n\n\"I have never viewed this as a policy election, but I think that it's very important point. If you look at Vice President Harris's speech, for example, at the Democratic Convention, it is a speech that Ronald Reagan could have given. It's a speech that George Bush could have given. It's very much an embrace and an understanding of the exceptional nature of this great nation,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that she has changed in a number of very important ways on issues that matter. And I would encourage independents to look at where she is on these policy issues today. I would encourage independents to compare where she is today with where Donald Trump is on these issues,\" she added. \"And on top of all of that, the Republicans have nominated somebody who you know is depraved.\"\n\nCheney seemed to recognize the stark departure from carrying on a career as a conservative warrior in the House to now endorsing a Democrat for president, suggesting that the GOP has shifted its values while she has remained consistent.\n\nWhen pressed by Karl if she's still a Republican, Cheney responded, \"I'm a conservative.\"\n\n\"I am certainly not a Trump Republican. I am a conservative. I think that what's happened to the Republican party today is indefensible, and I hope to be able to rebuild, as I said, after this cycle,\" Cheney said.\n\n\"But I also think it's really important for us as we're thinking about rebuilding, as we're thinking about the future the country, to recognize that at the end of the day, the vast majority of people in this country want to know fundamentally that their elected officials are going to defend the peaceful transfer of power,\" she said. \"And as someone who's been a lifelong Republican, it's heartbreaking to me to see what has happened to so many of the elected officials in my party, and I know we can do better.\""

            "text": "\u201cBlack,\u201d as in the capitalized identifier for the people, is everywhere. Is there not a strange air to its ubiquity? A feeling of religiosity? The writer publishing in the North American press can no longer be willful when deciding how she might like to dress the word. Many style guides, including the one used by this magazine, now capitalize the \u201cB\u201d: a person is Black; a culture is Black. This standard has even encroached on the genre of fiction, like a stop sign installed in the badlands. How does the satirist work around the imposition, constructing her nasty, sarcastic world of minstrelsy and sharp tongues? The race has been made proper.\n\n\u201cI believe that eight million Americans are entitled to a capital letter.\u201d This was W. E. B. Du Bois, ministering to literate society at the turn of the twentieth century, about the word \u201cnegro.\u201d In 1929, Du Bois, by then a star activist and editor, the ur-Black American intellectual, made the case again in a letter to Franklin Henry Hooper, his white editor at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica:\n\nFirst of all, the word \u201cNegro\u201d which was capitalized in my manuscript and which is already capitalized in everything I write, has been changed to a small letter. I feel very strongly on this point. I regard the use of a small letter for the name of twelve million Americans and two hundred million human beings as a personal insult, and under no circumstances will I allow this article to be published unless the word \u201cNegro\u201d is capitalized in this article. Of course, elsewhere in the Encyclopedia you will follow your own rule.\n\nThe letter was part of a larger pressure campaign, supported by Du Bois\u2019s contemporaries Alain Locke and W. A. Robinson, targeting the Britannica, the Times, and the other bulwarks of Western media. By 1930, the Times acquiesced. \u201cIt is not merely a typographical change, it is an act in recognition of racial respect for those who have been generations in the \u2018lower case,\u2019 \u201d the newspaper declared. A perfect echo of this dignity dogma appeared in the Times\u2019 2020 article \u201cWhy We\u2019re Capitalizing Black.\u201d An editor on the national desk is quoted as saying that \u201cfor many people the capitalization of that one letter is the difference between a color and a culture.\u201d The Associated Press, in a piece announcing its adoption of the same rule, also riffed on the color-not-a-person argument, which rings to me, at its most elemental, as an erasure of the role that the Black Power and Black Pride movements played in the shaping of how the people address themselves. (\u201cNegro\u201d didn\u2019t fall away as if a deciduous leaf; \u201cBlack\u201d was agitated for.)\n\nA month earlier, a police officer in Minneapolis had murdered George Floyd, pressing on his neck until he could no longer breathe. That feeling I mentioned, of a kind of religiosity associated with the capitalization of \u201cBlack,\u201d stems from this context\u2014the manic scene in which cultural institutions sought to brighten the imagined line separating them from the institutions of the state, by reasserting themselves as officers of language. The A.P., in its announcement, went full internationalist: the capitalized Black, its vice-president of standards wrote, promoted \u201can essential and shared sense of history, identity and community among people who identify as Black, including those in the African diaspora and within Africa.\u201d\n\nThe point was to denote and to define and to dignify, to bring the diaspora of dispersed Africans, former and present, into the hall of recognition enjoyed by the proper-noun ethnic categories. To shed Jesse Jackson\u2019s heavy hyphen in the formerly enshrined \u201cAfrican-American.\u201d To simultaneously give the Haitian, the Nigerian, and the American her distinctions while also linking them in sociological relation, implicitly rooted in an understanding of the Atlantic in which slavery launched the race. Here\u2019s where my mind gets caught on the wide net, flung across continents and across time. Everyone knows what it means to capitalize \u201cBlack.\u201d But how does it feel? On your tongue, on the page? If we act like affect isn\u2019t what truly rules how we talk to, and around, one another, we won\u2019t get to the whole of the matter.\n\nAnother time, another correspondence, although this time unanswered. Donald Harris, inflamed, writes a post for a Jamaican Web site, disciplining his eldest-born child, Kamala Harris, for her wanton assimilation. During her first Presidential campaign, which, in 2019, looked like it would be her only one, Kamala Harris had gone on \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d a radio show that has become an almost mandatory campaign stop for politicians seeking the Black vote, where she was asked a question about whether she had ever smoked marijuana. \u201cHalf of my family\u2019s from Jamaica,\u201d she replied. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Her father called upon her entire matriarchal line in order to admonish her:\n\nMy dear departed grandmothers (whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family\u2019s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics.\n\nDonald Harris\u2019s post, just like his daughter\u2019s joke, was a kind of mannered performance. The reaming was a hit among my friends and me, all of whom have parents who come from the Caribbean. We recognized his severity and his hyperbole, and then we recognized our laughing dismissal of his severity and his hyperbole as the mark of a cultural and generational difference. It is said that we don\u2019t know much about Harris pater\u2014aside from the fact that he is a Marxist bogeyman or miracle, depending on one\u2019s place on the political spectrum\u2014but, from the composition of his writings about family, I think we can glean something intense. He portrays himself as the proud Jamaican father, working hard to instill a sense of racial identity in his two children, taking them to visit his old schools in Kingston and in Port Antonio, fighting against the encroaching American secularities. \u201cA neegroe from da eyelans,\u201d is how he views the court viewing him, in the seventies, as he fought for custody of his children.\n\nKamala Harris and her campaigns, past and present, have actually made it a point not to focus too much on her race, or on her gender. Last week, Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, sat for their first televised interview, with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. Bash asked what Harris thought of Trump\u2019s musing that she \u201cturned Black\u201d for political gain. \u201cSame old tired playbook,\u201d Harris replied, speaking not only of Trump but seemingly of media avarice. \u201cNext question, please.\u201d Right, true, and warranted. But the question of Harris\u2019s race, although mainstreamed by Trump, wasn\u2019t originated by him. There exists a loose federation of Black Americans who look upon Black non-Americans as siphons of what reparative bounty should be theirs. The descendance from slavery, according to them, baptized the real inheritors of the Black condition. (Needless to say, this is an ahistorical and inaccurate view of transatlantic slavery.) They make hay out of statistics that suggest the success of Black non-Americans: the education level of the Nigerian, the earning power of the West Indian. Their movement is called ADOS, or American Descendants of Slavery. They are few but vocal enough online that they have been falsely accused of being Russian bots. Unlike Trump, ADOS\u2019s adherents cast a figure like Harris as something other than fraudulent; they see her, instead, as a usurper.\n\nMost Black Americans don\u2019t espouse the beliefs of ADOS. Plenty of Black Americans also have non-American ethnic identities. But the ADOS dissension is at the extreme end of a kind of conflict that is known as \u201cdiaspora warring.\u201d Diaspora warring is typically petty, unserious\u2014kitchen talk. (Who makes the best rice is always a point of argument.) But it is based in an acknowledgment of difference\u2014that Black-as-race has supplanted, in everyday language, Blackness-as-ethnicity. In acknowledging difference, this warring, as we facetiously call it, clings to lines of demarcation. It\u2019s Samuel L. Jackson, an American, on the occasion of Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out,\u201d starring Daniel Kaluuya, accusing British actors of taking roles that were meant for his countrymen. It\u2019s Buju Banton, a Jamaican reggae artist, criticizing Afrobeat artists for making music that is apolitical and soulless. I think, too, of intranational conversation\u2014critiques levelled by Black Texans, for example, toward Black Northerners, calling them out for misapprehending the regional particularity of Juneteenth. And then there\u2019s the Olympics. For years, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, the American sprinter, has annoyed some Jamaican track-and-field fans, who have taken her brashness as unearned hubris. Usain Bolt once played the wise man, suggesting that Richardson focus less on trash-talking and more on improving her game. This summer, during the Paris Games, some bits of the beef returned, but the mood was more playful. A couple of months earlier, Richardson had come to the Jamaica Athletics Invitational in Kingston. There, everyone took her as a sister."

Read preview\n\nAs part of her housing policy agenda, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has promised to \"cut red tape and needless bureaucracy\" to build millions of additional homes and bring down costs.\n\nEconomists and urban planners say that to make housing more abundant and affordable, we need to loosen zoning regulations in many neighborhoods and legalize the construction of denser, taller housing, such as duplexes, townhomes, and apartment buildings.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nA few countries have already figured out how to do that.\n\nZurich, Switzerland offers the latest model. As a small, mountainous country with limited buildable land and high demand, Switzerland has long been sensitive to urban sprawl. Starting in the mid-1990s, Swiss citizens voted to densify various parts of the Canton of Zurich, one of the country's 26 states and home to its biggest city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApartment buildings behind farm houses in Affoltern, just outside Zurich, Switzerland. Michael Buholzer/Reuters\n\nThe canton didn't uniformly alter its zoning laws. The citizens of each municipality voted on various proposals to \"upzone\" or allow more housing units by loosening zoning restrictions. The process was slow and staggered, and the average upzoning was quite incremental \u2014 think of a home with three floors that can add one extra floor. Much of the rezoning took place in neighborhoods surrounding Zurich's medieval city center, which is protected by historic preservation.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTwenty-five years into this process, a new study by Swiss researchers has found that upzoning boosted living space and housing units by a significant amount \u2014 about 9% in the subsequent five to 10 years \u2014 while keeping rent growth under control. The study found that areas that were hungriest for new housing were the most responsive to the policy changes. Areas with high demand, evidenced by high rents and home prices and already constrained by limits on housing, saw the most new construction. And the more density allowed, the more impactful the effect.\n\nOne of the study's key findings is, \"if you upzone, upzone a lot,\" said Simon B\u00fcchler, coauthor of the study and an assistant professor of finance at Miami University. \"Give people the incentive to build.\"\n\nIt provides more evidence that supply and demand can be harnessed to keep housing prices in check. Another example comes from New Zealand, where Auckland's upzoning measures legalizing the construction of medium-density housing slowed down skyrocketing housing costs. And a study of S\u00e3o Paulo's upzoning found similarly positive impacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZurich shows that upzoning is necessary but not sufficient. Allowing for more housing boosts affordability, but it takes time. There are a slew of other necessary fixes to bring housing costs down \u2014 from building-code changes to long-term expansion of services, infrastructure, and amenities.\n\n\"People think they're going to upzone and they're going to solve the affordability crisis in a couple of years. They're wrong,\" B\u00fcchler said. \"This is a long-term solution, but it is a solution that's necessary and that works.\"\n\nHomes in the town of K\u00fcsnacht on the banks of Lake Zurich in Switzerland. Christian Hartmann/Reuters\n\nKnee-capping NIMBYism\n\nThere are a few elements of Swiss law and society that make parts of the country more welcoming to development and resistant to NIMBYism, or \"Not In My Backyard\" anti-development sentiment, that cripples so much new construction in the US.\n\nUnlike most American cities, Zurich is a society of renters rather than homeowners. More than 70% of households are tenants. While property owners are incentivized to oppose additional housing in their neighborhoods that would boost supply and depress their home values, renters tend to be much more supportive of development that keeps rents affordable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also helps that European cities are generally more accomodating of higher-density living. A whopping 64% of Swiss residents live in apartments, compared to just 28% of US residents, and the country also has an especially comprehensive and well-connected public transportation network. While Zurich's population has grown significantly over the last quarter century, European cities tend to have more restrictive immigration laws than their counterparts in Canada, the US, and New Zealand.\n\n\"This evidence from Europe is important as it shows that upzoning can increase supply even in places where density is relatively more common and accepted, and overseas migration is less of a factor,\" Matthew Maltman, an Australian economist who's closely studied New Zealand's housing reforms, told Business Insider.\n\nThere's also a lot of certainty around how regulations function in Zurich, as opposed to in the US or New Zealand, which include more veto points in the building process, Maltman said. While developers can't apply to local authorities to bypass zoning regulations, local residents also can't lobby to stop a project from happening if it abides by the rules.\n\nAt the government level, municipalities are incentivized to welcome new residents because they disproportionately rely on income taxes for revenue, B\u00fcchler noted. Property taxes in Switzerland are very low, so the more density a city or town allows, the more income tax they can collect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nB\u00fcchler plans to investigate how rent changes in Zurich compare with other parts of Switzerland to get a better sense of the price impacts of upzoning. Ideally, deregulating zoning would bring prices down. But B\u00fcchler considers it a win that rents were unchanged in Zurich, when adjusted for housing quality, even as the canton's population and demand for housing grew. \"It doesn't mean that upzoning didn't help. What it means is that without the upzoning, we would have seen even more rent increases than what we've seen,\" he said.\n\nZurich's example is crucial in informing policy change in places like the US because real-world evidence of the effects of upzoning can help convince governments and voters to act.\n\n\"Economists have argued the case for zoning reform based upon other evidence \u2014 usually based upon economic theory or sophisticated economic models,\" Maltman said. \"It can be easier to sell the public on place X implemented policy Y and it had Z effect.\""

I don't think he knows what he said either.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with Vice President Kamala Harris now running against him, Trump faces a much stiffer rhetorical challenge, with his speeches seeming all the more chaotic. The two candidates will hold their first debate on Tuesday."

            "text": "Kurz vor dem mit Spannung erwarteten TV-Duell zwischen dem republikanischen Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump und seiner demokratischen Kontrahentin Kamala Harris liegen die beiden US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten in Umfragen weiter ungef\u00e4hr gleichauf. Eine neue Befragung d\u00fcrfte im Wahlkampfteam der Demokratin aber als Warnzeichen gewertet werden.\n\nIn einer von der \u00abNew York Times\u00bb in Auftrag gegebenen Umfrage unter wahrscheinlichen W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hlern liegt die Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Trump bei 48 Prozent, Harris kommt auf 47 Prozent. Blickt man auf alle registrierten W\u00e4hler, liegt Harris bei 46 Prozent und Trump bei 48 Prozent. Der Abstand ist im Bereich der Fehlertoleranz von 3 Prozent.\n\nTrump habe nach dem R\u00fcckzug von US-Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden aus dem Rennen zwar einen harten Monat hinter sich, aber die Umfrage zeige, dass seine Unterst\u00fctzung bemerkenswert stabil sei, so die Zeitung. Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage d\u00fcrften die Demokraten \u00abwieder auf den Boden der Tatsachen zur\u00fcckholen\u00bb.\n\nAn dieser Stelle ist ein externer Inhalt eingebunden Zum Anschauen ben\u00f6tigen wir Ihre Zustimmung Bitte aktivieren Sie JavaScript damit Sie diesen Inhalt anzeigen k\u00f6nnen. Weiter\n\nTV-Debatte wird Bew\u00e4hrungsprobe f\u00fcr Harris\n\nVor der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl am 5. November macht in den USA so ziemlich jede neue Befragung Schlagzeilen. Auf die aktuelle Umfrage wird gerade besonders geschaut, weil sie erstmals einen Vorsprung f\u00fcr Trump in einer gro\u00dfen \u00fcberparteilichen nationalen Befragung seit rund einem Monat zeigt. Allerdings l\u00e4sst sich zum jetzigen seri\u00f6s nicht sagen, ob die Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Harris ins Stocken geraten ist und der Hype um sie nach dem Einstieg ins Rennen nachl\u00e4sst. Daf\u00fcr braucht es weitere Umfragen. Die neue Befragung unterstreiche die Risiken und potenziellen Chancen, mit denen Harris beim TV-Duell am 10. September (Ortszeit/11. September MESZ) konfrontiert sei, so die \u00abNew York Times\u00bb.\n\nUmfragen mit begrenzter Aussagekraft\n\nEine Auswertung des US-Senders CNN mehrerer seit dem Parteitag der Demokraten im August durchgef\u00fchrten Umfragen zeigt ebenfalls ein enges Rennen zwischen der 59-Jahren alten Harris und dem 78-j\u00e4hrigen Trump ohne klaren Spitzenreiter. Demnach kommt Harris auf 49 Prozent Unterst\u00fctzung, Trump auf 47 Prozent. Wegen des besonderen Wahlsystems in den USA sind nationale Befragungen ohnehin nur ein Stimmungsbarometer. Wichtig ist der Blick auf die sogenannten Swing States. In diesen hart umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaaten steht nicht schon vorab fest, ob aus Tradition der Kandidat der Republikaner oder der Demokraten siegen wird. Auch hier liegen Trump und Harris weiter ungef\u00e4hr gleichauf.\n\nGro\u00dfe B\u00fchne in Philadelphia\n\nBei dem bevorstehenden TV-Duell stehen sich der Republikaner und die Demokratin im Wahlkampf erstmals auf einer B\u00fchne gegen\u00fcber. Zuvor hatten sich beide Wahlkampfteams \u00fcber die Regeln gestritten. F\u00fcr Trump ist es in diesem Wahlkampf bereits das zweite Pr\u00e4sidentschafts-Fernsehduell. Im Juni stand er gemeinsam mit dem damaligen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerber Biden auf einer B\u00fchne in Atlanta im Bundesstaat Georgia. Bidens Auftritt war so desastr\u00f6s, dass der 81-J\u00e4hrige schlie\u00dflich seine Vize Harris als Nachfolge ins Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen schickte. Diese trifft nun in Philadelphia im Swing State Pennsylvania auf Trump.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240908-930-226825/1"

            "text": "Debates have proved a tough test for vice presidents running for president\n\ntoggle caption Grace Widyatmadja/NPR\n\nSince the era of TV debates began in 1960, there have been 17 presidential election cycles and all but three have featured at least one televised faceoff between the nominees of the major parties.\n\nWhen Vice President Harris takes the stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night on ABC with former President Donald Trump, she will be the first sitting vice president to debate someone who had actually been president.\n\nBut there have been six others who were vice president or had a history in that office when they debated on TV as their party\u2019s nominee for the Oval Office. And their record has been mostly one of disappointment, both in the debate itself and in the election that followed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThree were outshone in the debates and then defeated in the election that followed. All three retired from politics thereafter.\n\nTwo held their own in their debates the year they won the nation\u2019s ultimate office, only to stumble in their debates as incumbents four years later and be denied reelection.\n\nAnd there was the very first vice president who debated on TV as the nominee of his party, Richard Nixon, whose performance in 1960 may have cost him an election and cast a shadow on the era of presidential debates that followed.\n\n\n\nNixon puts his stamp on the era\n\nFor more than 60 years, Richard Nixon\u2019s performance in the first debate ever televised between presidential nominees has been held up as an example of campaign error. Nixon had been ill and was reluctant to use much TV make-up for his paleness and his famous \u201cfive o\u2019clock shadow.\u201d The contrast was notable in the era of black-and-white television.\n\ntoggle caption MPI/Archive Photos/Getty Images/Archive Photos\n\nMoreover, Nixon seemed ill at ease, especially in contrast to the supremely confident demeanor of his opponent, the young Democratic senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. Still introducing himself to much of the nation, Kennedy managed to convey seriousness commensurate with the office he was seeking. And while the debate format did not give him much chance to charm, his soon-to-be legendary charisma had a way of glimmering through.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome scholars have argued that too much was made of the Nixon-JFK debate and its contrasts, given that much of the nation did not watch and there was little measurable effect on the polls.\n\nBut the impression that \u201cNixon blew it\u201d took on a life of its own.\n\nIn 1964, the man who succeeded to the presidency on Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson, saw little reason to risk a debate with his opponent, Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona. There was no debate and LBJ won in a landslide.\n\nFour years later, LBJ was leaving office and Nixon was again the Republican nominee. This time, Nixon was leading in the polls and saw himself with more to lose than gain in a debate. So he did not debate his opponent (sitting Vice President Hubert Humphrey) and won in November.\n\nAs an incumbent in 1972, sailing to reelection in a 49-state blowout, Nixon would again demur on the suggestion of debates.\n\n\n\nFord brings the debate back into focus\n\nBut much changed after Nixon\u2019s reelection, beginning with his own fortunes. Probes of burglaries and other offenses by his 1972 campaign operatives led him to oversee a White House cover-up of what was known as the Watergate scandal. That in turn led to more investigations and Nixon resigned as Congress was about to impeach him in 1974.\n\nHe was succeeded by his vice president, Gerald Ford, whom Nixon had appointed to replace his first vice president, who had resigned due to scandals of his own.\n\ntoggle caption Universal History Archive/Getty Images/Universal Images Group Editorial\n\nFord, a longtime Republican member of Congress from Michigan and a party leader, did not have much time to establish himself as vice president before taking over the Oval Office. And he alienated many by issuing a blanket pardon for Nixon. Still, he beat back a challenge to his nomination in 1976 and entered the fall campaign that year with a decent chance to win a term of his own. He wanted to debate the Democratic nominee, former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, to establish his own bona fides and emerge from Nixon\u2019s shadow.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt was the first time the two major party nominees had agreed to a TV showdown in 16 years.\n\nBoth candidates were relatively new to the national scene. Carter stressed his executive experience, his roots in the rural South and his commitment to the civil rights movement as well as to his Baptist faith.\n\nBut Ford held his own on the debate stage, at least until he offered up a line that would dominate much of the news reporting on TV and in print. When a question arose about Nixon\u2019s policy of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and its effect on Eastern European countries still behind the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d of communism, Ford said he did not think Poles felt dominated.\n\nGiven that Poland had been occupied by Soviet troops and central to the pro-Moscow \u201cWarsaw Pact\u201d for decades after World War II, Ford\u2019s answer was construed by some as na\u00efve. Fairly or not, it weakened his image as the candidate best prepared to represent the U.S. on the world stage.\n\n\n\nThe debates giveth and taketh away\n\nThe next vice president to be nominated for president by either party was Walter Mondale, who had served in that role during the one term Carter won in 1976. In 1980, Mondale had watched Carter march confidently into a debate with his Republican challenger of that year, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan. He had seen how Reagan\u2019s blend of tough talk and avuncular likability upstaged Carter\u2019s own style of personal appeal.\n\nYet when Mondale won the nomination to challenge Reagan\u2019s reelection in 1984, he was eager to debate the incumbent. He knew he needed something powerful to overcome Reagan\u2019s aura of success and lead in the polls. Some in Reagan\u2019s circle saw little reason to debate the underdog and may have wondered whether, at 73, the nation\u2019s oldest president might be showing some signs of age.\n\ntoggle caption Bettmann/Bettmann Archive/Bettmann\n\nIn the first debate that fall, Reagan did seem less than sharp and a bit confused at times, prompting concern in the GOP and giving Democrats hope. But at a second debate, Reagan took a question about age as an issue and made it a deft joke about \u201cmy opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d He went on to win 49 states.\n\nReagan\u2019s own vice president, George H.W. Bush, managed to subdue a field of challengers in 1988 to win the nomination to succeed him. He was not seen as a compelling figure onstage and had struggled in debates in other cycles, but he helped himself in his meeting with the Democratic nominee that year, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.\n\nHaving been Reagan\u2019s backup for eight years, Bush was ready to parry attacks on the weak points of the administration\u2019s record and eager to wrap himself in his predecessor\u2019s enduring personal popularity. Dukakis stressed his cool \u201ccompetence\u201d and at times sounded technocratic.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBush may not have been especially impressive, but he was the more personable of the two.\n\nThat kind of contest was far harder for Bush to win four years later, when he found himself onstage against a young Bill Clinton, then the savvy and smooth-talking governor of Arkansas, who was 22 years his junior \u2014 the widest age gap between the major party nominees since before the Civil War.\n\nBush also found himself debating H. Ross Perot, a billionaire running as an independent who had soared in opinion polls after spending some of his fortune on TV ads attacking both parties and Bush in particular.\n\nAs the incumbent president, Bush was the centerpiece of the debates in 1992 but was not their focal point. He seemed at times to recede, caught between the two more dynamic personalities of his opponents. He seemed to underline this when caught glancing at his wristwatch and betraying a sense of impatience.\n\ntoggle caption Ron Edmonds/AP\n\nWhen Clinton won the presidency that year, his running mate was Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, who had little trouble winning the nomination to succeed Clinton in 2000. The economy was humming along, personal computers were transforming work and school and Gore had worked hard to separate himself from Clinton\u2019s impeachment over an affair with a young White House intern.\n\nIronically, his opponent was another George Bush, the namesake son of the former president and himself a reelected governor of Texas. Gore and Bush held three televised debates that fall, and while neither candidate was regarded as having dominated, Gore\u2019s efforts to belittle Bush as a lightweight may have backfired. His habit of rolling his eyes in mock disbelief struck some as condescending. And while the younger Bush was not a scintillating debater, he had the quality campaign consultants call \u201crelatability.\u201d\n\nThe importance of the debates in 2000 is itself debatable, as was the importance of these events in previous cycles. In the end, it probably mattered more that a third-party bid by consumer activist Ralph Nader split some of the Democratic vote in key states \u2014 especially Florida. That was the year that state made the difference in the Electoral College after giving the Republican a popular vote edge of just 537 votes statewide.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe return of the two-edged sword\n\nThe most recent one-term president in the TV debate era might also be said to have both benefited and suffered from debating before the nation. The current resident of the White House, President Biden, probably helped himself in some measure by withstanding the fury of his opponent in the 2020 debates.\n\nThat opponent was, of course, Donald Trump, who was still a formidable incumbent that fall after surviving an impeachment vote in the Senate and a bout with COVID, both in his reelection year. In the end, his efforts to downplay the COVID threat and blame others for its economic impact were the main contributors to his defeat that fall. But he seemed resolved to blow Biden off the stage with his aggressive performance, especially in the first of those two meetings that fall.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nBiden had in fact not been seen as a world-class debater in his several bids for the presidency, particularly onstage as a rival to eventual nominee Barack Obama in 2008. But he had been a six-term senator and still retained much of the positive impression he had made as Obama\u2019s vice president for the eight years that followed. He did not run to succeed his boss in 2016. His son Beau was battling cancer, and Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, had already taken the inside lane to that year\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut in 2020, in his late 70s, Biden ran for president and this time found the formula. He survived a weak start in the primaries and won the nomination going away \u2014 thanks largely to strong support among African American voters.\n\nThat fall, Biden had two televised debates with the incumbent Trump. The first, in September, was notable chiefly for Trump\u2019s highly aggressive style, interrupting and commenting audibly when it was Biden\u2019s turn to speak and generally ignoring moderators\u2019 attempt to moderate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe second Trump-Biden debate, in October, proved less raucous. But Trump once again sacrificed the air of incumbency favored in the past by sitting presidents and remained relentlessly on offense against Biden.\n\nThis fall, Trump is the first former president to be nominated again after being defeated since Grover Cleveland in 1892.\n\nAnd he will be facing the current vice president who was elected alongside Biden four years ago. Harris and Trump have never met face to face. But it seems a good bet that Harris will be reviewing the videotape of Trump\u2019s performance in those debates four years ago."

            "text": "Here\u2019s where Trump and Harris stand on 6 education issues\n\ntoggle caption LA Johnson/NPR\n\nAs presidential candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump don\u2019t have a lot in common when it comes to their views on education.\n\nTrump has said America\u2019s public schools \u201chave been taken over by the radical Left maniacs,\u201d and that he wants to close the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nHarris has vowed to keep the department open.\n\nDemocrats are for free, universal preschool for all 4-year-olds.\n\nRepublicans are for universal school choice, where parents have the power \u2014 and the public dollars \u2014 to enroll their children in any school they want, whether it\u2019s public or private.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nAhead of the candidates\u2019 only scheduled debate, in Philadelphia on Tuesday, we\u2019ve put together a handy primer of their education views.\n\n\n\n1. On closing the U.S. Department of Education\n\nTrump, in an interview on X , told Elon Musk that, if elected, \u201cI want to close up the Department of Education, move education back to the states.\u201d\n\nHarris didn\u2019t talk much about education in her DNC speech , but she did parry Trump\u2019s plan: \u201cWe are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools.\u201d\n\nA quick explanatory comma about that funding: Most public school funding comes from states and local communities. But the department does administer two large funding streams, now more than $30 billion, that Congress codified into law decades ago to help schools educate 1.) children with disabilities and 2.) kids living in low-income communities.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Trump\u2019s desire to close the department would also mean disrupting this funding.\n\nProject 2025, a blueprint for the next Republican presidency that included input from Trump loyalists, recommends closing the department, turning both funding streams into no-strings-attached grants and phasing out the low-income support dollars within 10 years.\n\nBut the Trump campaign has disavowed Project 2025. NPR asked the campaign to clarify its position on funding for children with disabilities and kids living in low-income communities, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded: \u201cPresident Trump will ensure a great education for every child by returning our education system to the states where it belongs.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department debate isn\u2019t just financial. It\u2019s also symbolic.\n\nTrump and some Republicans believe, fundamentally, that education should only be a local and state concern, as there\u2019s no mention of a federal role in education in the U.S. Constitution. To them the department is the poster child for government overreach, which is why Republicans have been calling for the department\u2019s dissolution ever since it was created in 1979.\n\nWhere Republicans see local control of education as an inherently good thing, allowing schools to better reflect the values of their communities, Harris and many Democrats also see inequity in some districts\u2019 inability (and sometimes unwillingness) to serve marginalized students.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCongress created those funding streams to help level the playing field and to give the department the ability to hold districts accountable when they fall short on civil rights. Harris has previously backed increasing funding for low-income students and children with disabilities.\n\nDisagreements aside, can the department be shut down?\n\nNot by the president, no. It was created by Congress, and only Congress can close it. Some House Republicans have tried , but there\u2019s simply not enough support, not just among Democrats but Republicans, too. Public surveys show even a majority of Republicans believe the U.S. government should be spending more, not less, on education.\n\nKeep in mind, eight years ago then-presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested he might try to close the Education Department. He then got his chance as president \u2014 with Republican control of Congress \u2014 but never forced the issue.\n\n\n\n2. On sex-based discrimination in schools, aka Title IX\n\nIn April, the Biden-Harris administration expanded protections against sex discrimination in schools to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Meaning, among other things, it believes students should be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.\n\nThis is not a change in federal law. That requires Congress. It\u2019s a change in interpretation of the law, known as Title IX, courtesy of new regulations from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nTrump and many Republicans see this expanded interpretation of Title IX as Democrats imposing liberalism on schools. In a recent call with reporters, representatives of the Trump campaign and the RNC repeatedly derided what they called Harris\u2019 \u201cradical gender ideology.\u201d\n\nIf this sounds all-too-familiar, that\u2019s because this is an old fight. In 2016, the Obama administration issued guidance to schools , telling them that students should be allowed to use the bathroom facilities that correspond with their gender identity.\n\nIn early 2017, the nascent Trump administration quickly moved in the opposite direction, abandoning that interpretation of the law.\n\nProtesting these latest Biden administration provisions, roughly half of all states have sued the department, and the courts have blocked the Education Department from enforcing the regulations in those states. Trump has said, if re-elected, he would roll back the rule, just as he did the old Obama-era guidance.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n3. On school choice\n\nWe\u2019re using \u201cchoice\u201d here broadly because many of Trump\u2019s education proposals shoot from the same root: That parents should have total or near-total control over their child\u2019s education.\n\nFirst, he\u2019s calling for universal school choice. This would, in theory, take public dollars normally spent on a child\u2019s public education and give them directly to parents to spend at whatever school they want, whether it\u2019s public, private or homeschooling at the kitchen table.\n\nHe has also called for a Parental Bill of Rights and for school principals to be hired \u2014 and fired \u2014 by parents. \u201cIf any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to vote to fire them and select someone who will. This will be the ultimate form of local control,\u201d Trump said in July.\n\nTrump also wants to make it easier to fire \u201cbad\u201d teachers, by ending tenure protections, and to reward strong teachers with merit pay. \u201cIf we have pink-haired Communists teaching our kids, we have a major problem. When I am president, we will put PARENTS back in charge and give them the final say,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how a second Trump administration could implement these ideas around school choice or principal and teacher retention, though, as the U.S. government has limited power to influence state and school district policy.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, made clear in their 2024 platform that they\u2019re against any effort that could weaken the nation\u2019s public schools. \u201cWe oppose the use of private-school vouchers, tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education. Public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s likely a reference to the fact that, in some state voucher programs, a private school is allowed to reject children with disabilities if it doesn\u2019t believe it has the staff or resources to meet their needs. Federal law requires that schools that receive federal funding provide kids with disabilities a free and appropriate public education.\n\nIn a letter to Harris , some two-dozen grassroots education groups urged her not to choose Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to be her running mate, because of his previous support for private-school vouchers . She ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former public school teacher and coach.\n\nHarris has been an outspoken supporter of public education and has been courting educators\u2019 support. In a speech to the American Federation of Teachers, she told the crowd, \u201cWe need you so desperately right now,\u201d and called it \u201cthe most noble of work, teaching other people\u2019s children.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs part of her presidential bid in 2019, Harris proposed a $300 billion plan to raise teacher pay. Though she has not revived the plan, she did tell the AFT, \u201cGod knows we don\u2019t pay you enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. On early childhood education and support\n\nHarris and Democrats have talked as much, if not more, about early childhood education and childcare than they have about K-12 policies. Harris has proposed expanding the Child Tax Credit after a brief, pandemic-era expansion dramatically cut child poverty , and she pitched an even larger boost of up to $6,000 for newborns.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 2024 platform also includes support for free, universal preschool for 4-year-olds, something the Biden-Harris administration had previously championed but was forced to abandon in negotiations with Congress.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Head Start, the federally-funded program that provides child care and early learning for children from low-income families. The Biden-Harris administration has been a staunch supporter of Head Start, which serves children from birth to age 5. In her DNC speech , Harris promised not to let Trump \u201cend programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care.\u201d\n\nHarris was likely referring, again, to Project 2025 , which alleges Head Start is \u201cfraught with scandal and abuse\u201d and recommends eliminating it entirely. Congressional funding for Head Start rose during the Trump administration, in spite of the White House calling for modest cuts .\n\nNPR asked the Trump campaign to clarify its position on Head Start funding. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded: \u201cBy returning our education system back to the states, our early childhood education system will thrive because parents will have more say in their child\u2019s education and good teachers will be rewarded.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. On banning books and \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d\n\nBetween July and December 2023, PEN America recorded more than 4,300 instances of school book bans, a big uptick from the previous year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOf the books that were targeted in the 2021-\u201922 and \u201822-\u201923 school years, the nonprofit found that 37% grappled with race and racism and included characters of color, and 36% included LGBTQ+ characters and themes.\n\nTrump has been an unabashed champion of efforts to limit how schools approach issues of race and gender. In 2020, he created the 1776 Commission , which lamented that \u201cmany students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains.\u201d\n\nSince then, some states have passed laws curtailing what teachers can and cannot say in the classroom when it comes to matters of race and gender. And in July, as part of his Plan To Save American Education , Trump pledged to \u201ccut federal funding for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content,\u201d though it\u2019s not clear how or if he could do that.\n\nKamala Harris used her speech before the American Federation of Teachers to blast Trump.\n\n\u201cWhile you teach students about our nation\u2019s past,\u201d she told the crowd of teachers, \u201cthese extremists attack the freedom to learn and acknowledge our nation\u2019s true and full history, including book bans. Book bans in this year of our Lord 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. On college affordability\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration went all-in on federal student loan forgiveness. Some of its plans worked , but the administration has so far failed to convince the courts that its most ambitious efforts at loan forgiveness are legal.\n\nThat may explain why, on the campaign trail, Harris isn\u2019t talking much about future loan forgiveness, or making new promises. Instead, she\u2019s largely backward-looking.\n\n\u201cOur administration has forgiven student loan debt for nearly 5 million Americans,\u201d Harris told the American Federation of Teachers gathering, emphasizing that many of those Americans are teachers who received Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs a senator and vice president, Harris has also supported efforts to make community college free, a commitment echoed in the 2024 Democratic party platform .\n\nAs for Trump, as president he previously tried to eliminate PSLF , and he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have both spoken out against broad loan forgiveness.\n\nIn 2023, after the Supreme Court blocked Biden\u2019s first big effort, Trump celebrated : \u201cPresident Biden is not allowed to wipe out hundreds and hundreds of billions, probably trillions, of dollars in student loan debt, which would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who have paid their debt through hard work and diligence.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 Republican party platform pledges , \u201cto reduce the cost of Higher Education, Republicans will support the creation of additional, drastically more affordable alternatives to a traditional four-year College degree.\u201d\n\nLast year, Trump unveiled plans for an online college alternative he\u2019s calling The American Academy: \u201cWe will take the billions and billions of dollars that we will collect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments, and we will then use that money to endow a new institution\u2026 Its mission will be to make a truly world-class education available to every American, free of charge, and do it without adding a single dime to the federal debt.\u201d"

He also revisited his rhetoric on migrants and egregiously claimed women in blue states are executing babies. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nHe also once again addressed he and his VP running mate J.D.

On Saturday, he said the \u201cfake news\u201d called him and his VP nominee \u201cweird,\u201d but Trump accused Harris\u2019 VP running mate Tim Walz as being the \u201cweird\u201d one because he signed into Minnesota law that schools require access to menstrual products in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. \u201cHe is really weird, this guy,\u201d he said of Walz. \u201cCan you imagine, I\u2019m weird?\u201d\n\nTrump has been losing some of his support in several demographic groups since Harris took over the top spot on the Democratic ticket, formally accepting the party\u2019s nomination in August.

However, her support among white voters without a college degree has remained about the same, while that demographic supports Trump by 25 points, per the same poll.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has raked in record-breaking donations, while Trump has been banking on billionaires to try to put him back in the White House.

Le pr\u00e9sident russe a ainsi assur\u00e9 : \u00abJe l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, notre favori, si je puis dire, \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident en exercice, Joe Biden.

Donc nous ferons de m\u00eame, nous la soutiendrons.\u00bb\n\nUne sortie pour le moins contre-intuitive qui a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une importante couverture dans la presse \u2013 y compris dans Lib\u00e9 \u2013 o\u00f9 l\u2019information a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 relay\u00e9e, dans un premier temps du moins, au premier degr\u00e9. Une heure apr\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9p\u00eache sur le sujet, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s largement reprise, l\u2019AFP a publi\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me version, insistant d\u00e9sormais sur le \u00absarcasme\u00bb du pr\u00e9sident russe. Et pr\u00e9cisant, dans un titre plus pr\u00e9cis, que ce dernier s\u2019exprimait \u00abdans un sourire\u00bb. De quoi relativiser le s\u00e9rieux de la d\u00e9claration du leader russe, mais de nombreux m\u00e9dias n\u2019en sont rest\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re version.\n\nMoqueries misogynes\n\nPourtant, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019un \u00abtrolling\u00bb, voire d\u2019une volont\u00e9 d\u2019ing\u00e9rence de la part de Vladimir Poutine est aujourd\u2019hui largement d\u00e9fendue. D\u2019abord parce qu\u2019on trouve dans cette d\u00e9claration la phrase suivante, qui a tout d\u2019une remarque ironique, prononc\u00e9e devant un public et une pr\u00e9sentatrice hilares. Au sujet de Kamala Harris, Poutine lance ainsi : \u00abElle a un rire si expressif et contagieux qu\u2019il montre que tout va bien pour elle. Et je veux dire que Trump a impos\u00e9 plus de restrictions et de sanctions \u00e0 la Russie qu\u2019aucun pr\u00e9sident ne l\u2019avait fait auparavant. Et si madame Harris se porte bien, peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019elle s\u2019abstiendra de faire quelque chose de ce genre.\u00bb Dans cette campagne pour la Maison Blanche, cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au rire de Kamala Harris n\u2019est ni neutre ni laudateur. Elle rel\u00e8ve m\u00eame d\u2019un clin d\u2019\u0153il \u00e9vident aux \u00e9lecteurs de Trump, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce rire, jug\u00e9 trop d\u00e9monstratif, est au c\u0153ur de moqueries teint\u00e9es, notamment, de misogynie, ouvrant la voie aux accusations en hyst\u00e9rie.\n\nCette d\u00e9claration intervient, par ailleurs, dans un contexte d\u2019accusations d\u2019ing\u00e9rence russe de la part des autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. Mercredi, le minist\u00e8re de la Justice am\u00e9ricain a annonc\u00e9 des sanctions et des mesures p\u00e9nales autour de l\u2019action de la cha\u00eene de propagande russe RT (RussiaToday), accus\u00e9e de mener une campagne d\u2019influence sur la population am\u00e9ricaine dans le cadre des \u00e9lections imminentes. Ainsi que l\u2019\u00e9crit l\u2019agence de presse AP, il appara\u00eet que cette campagne \u00e9tait men\u00e9e au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Donald Trump, le ministre de la Justice Merrick Garland affirmant que \u00ables pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de la Russie n\u2019avaient pas chang\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9lection\u00bb.

Et donc essayer \u00abde l\u2019aider par cette prise de distance, m\u00eame si cela est maladroit et peut sembler incoh\u00e9rent\u00bb. Ce que Poutine a par ailleurs tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire, Kamala Harris se tenant fermement aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de l\u2019Ukraine dans le contexte de la guerre avec la Russie, tandis que Trump s\u2019est montr\u00e9 critique des sommes engendr\u00e9es par le soutien des Etats-Unis \u00e0 l\u2019Ukraine.\n\nUn cadeau empoisonn\u00e9, en somme, pour Kamala Harris. Donald Trump n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pas manqu\u00e9 de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 cette s\u00e9quence \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Au Economic Club of New York, o\u00f9 il s\u2019est d\u2019abord montr\u00e9 mitig\u00e9, indiquant : \u00abJe ne sais pas si je me sens insult\u00e9, ou s\u2019il m\u2019a rendu service.\u00bb\n\nMIXED EMOTIONS: \"I don't know if I'm insulted or he did me a favor.\" Former President Trump gives raw reaction to Vladimir Putin's apparent endorsement of Vice President Harris. https://t.co/YIvZV1ugh3 pic.twitter.com/dlmcipl1in \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) September 6, 2024\n\nDans un second temps, lors d\u2019un meeting, il a finalement tranch\u00e9, se disant \u00aboffens\u00e9\u00bb : \u00abJe ne sais pas si vous avez vu l\u2019autre jour, Poutine a apport\u00e9 son soutien \u00e0 Kamala [Harris].

A l\u2019image de cet internaute trumpiste qui rel\u00e8ve, au passage, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au rire de la rivale d\u00e9mocrate : \u00ab\u201cSon rire est si fascinant\u2026\u201d Poutine soutient Kamala Harris.

En ao\u00fbt, Donald Trump a lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 deux reprises, affirm\u00e9 que Kamala Harris avait rencontr\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident russe juste avant la guerre en Ukraine, au mois de f\u00e9vrier 2022. Lors d\u2019un meeting en Caroline du Nord, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00abRappelez-vous quand le pr\u00e9sident Biden a envoy\u00e9 Kamala en Europe pour mettre fin \u00e0 la guerre en Ukraine. Elle a rencontr\u00e9 Poutine pour lui dire \u201cNe le faites pas.\u201d Et trois jours apr\u00e8s, il a attaqu\u00e9. Voil\u00e0 comment \u00e7a a commenc\u00e9.\u00bb\n\nPuis, lors d\u2019une interview, il a cette fois indiqu\u00e9 que Biden avait envoy\u00e9 Kamala Harris en Russie rencontrer Vladimir Poutine. Or, si Kamala Harris s\u2019est bien rendue en Europe mi-f\u00e9vrier (plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 Munich en Allemagne o\u00f9 elle a fait des d\u00e9clarations pro-Ukraine), aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne permet d\u2019attester d\u2019un voyage en Russie, encore moins d\u2019une rencontre avec le pr\u00e9sident russe."

            "text": "The United Auto Workers said on Wednesday that a battery manufacturing joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution has agreed to recognize the union at a Tennessee plant.\n\nThe UAW said a majority of the employees at the Ultium Cells facility signed cards to join the UAW and the company had agreed to recognize the union after workers at an Ohio Ultium plant overwhelmingly voted to join the union in 2022 and won a new contract earlier this year with significant wage hikes.\n\nThe Tennessee factory employs 1,000 workers and produces batteries for GM's electric vehicles built in a nearby assembly plant, including the Cadillac Lyriq.\n\n\u201cThe team at Ultium Cells in Tennessee has indicated their desire to be represented by the UAW. The parties will now move into the local bargaining process,\" a GM spokesman said.\n\nA spokesperson for Ultium Cells confirmed it has recognized the UAW at the Spring Hill facility. Representatives for LG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGM's battery operations were a point of contention in last year's UAW contract negotiations, during which the union held strikes at plants across the Big Three automakers for six weeks.\n\nThe automaker eventually agreed to let its Ultium battery plants come under the union's master agreement once a majority of workers decide to unionize.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain is leading a $40 million nationwide organizing effort, targeting large automakers such as Toyota and Tesla.\n\nThe union notched a win at Volkswagen in April when 73% of voting workers at a plant in Tennessee opted to join the UAW's ranks, making it the first auto plant in the South to unionize via an election since the 1940s.\n\nWorkers at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama weeks after the win voted against joining the union. The UAW said earlier this year that more than 30% of employees at a Hyundai plant in Alabama and at a Missouri Toyota auto parts factory have signed cards indicating they want to join the UAW.\n\nThe union's executive board recently endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for president, emphasizing that the Democrat stands with workers more than Republican former President Donald Trump. Fain and Trump have exchanged barbs over the last few months, with Fain calling the former president a \"scab\" and Trump calling for Fain to be fired.\n\nHaving the backing of the next administration could provide support for the union's ongoing organizing efforts, but it will likely not make or break them, labor professors have said.\n\n(Reporting by Nora Eckert and David Shepardson; Editing by Philippa Fletcher and Mark Porter)"

            "headline": "Ahead of the US presidential debate, how are Harris and Trump preparing?",
            "text": "Experts weigh in on the strategies the Democratic and Republican candidates may deploy on Tuesday\u2019s debate stage.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 On one side of the stage will be the prosecutor, seeking to dismiss her opponent as a danger to democracy and a vestige of the past.\n\nAnd on the other will be the real estate magnate, blasting his rival as an ultra-liberal politician who will regulate the economy into stagnation.\n\nTuesday\u2019s presidential debate will be the first opportunity for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to meet face-to-face as they spar over the future of the United States.\n\nAnd the two candidates have been sharpening their attacks and plotting a strategy to pull ahead in their neck-and-neck race.\n\nThe televised debate, hosted by ABC News, may well turn out to be the only opportunity for Harris and Trump to confront one another in person before the November 5 election.\n\nAnd that means the stakes are high. Aaron Kall, a professor at the University of Michigan, studies presidential debates and warns not to dismiss their importance.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t win you an election, but certainly they can lose it,\u201d Kall said.\n\nThe shadow of June\u2019s debate\n\nThe showdown in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the second presidential debate this election cycle.\n\nBut experts said the casualties of the first debate should serve as a warning for the participants this time around.\n\nThe first debate took place on June 27, and it was the lightning rod that took down President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nThe presumptive Democratic candidate at the time, Biden faltered as he faced Trump on the debate stage, trailing off mid-sentence and failing to articulate basic talking points.\n\nHis feeble performance led to a crescendo of concerns over the 81-year-old\u2019s age and ability.\n\nLess than a month later, Biden had dropped out of the race, and Harris soon replaced him as the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut experts say the events of the transformative June debate will loom large as Harris and her Republican rival Trump craft their strategies for Tuesday. Some predict Biden\u2019s bellyflop may even bring more eyeballs to Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThe Biden and Trump debate, you can say in a declarative sentence, was the most consequential presidential debate in American history,\u201d Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia, told Al Jazeera. \u201cSo it shows the stakes are real and high.\u201d\n\nKall, meanwhile, pointed to the June debate as evidence that a high-profile blunder can cost a candidate the election.\n\n\u201cIn a 90-minute debate, you can make a mistake or gaffe or do something that brands you going forward \u2014 like Biden not having the stamina to do another four years,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris\u2019s strategy\n\nBoth the Harris and Trump campaigns have been mum about the tactics they plan to use for Tuesday\u2019s debate. After all, airing their strategies in public could blunt their efficacy.\n\nBut Harris\u2019s team appears to be hoping to give Trump a runway to crash his own plane.\n\nHer campaign unsuccessfully called for Trump\u2019s microphone to be unmuted between questions, to allow him to speak out of turn.\n\nThat was a reversal of what Biden\u2019s campaign had pushed for in June. Biden\u2019s team had hoped a muted microphone would stymy the outburst-prone Trump, particularly with no audience in attendance.\n\nInstead, \u201cit backfired\u201d, according to Kall. He believes the silence gave Trump a more staid appearance, one that emphasised Biden\u2019s stumbles.\n\nHarris\u2019s team appeared to be hoping for a repeat of an earlier Trump and Biden debate, in Cleveland in 2020, when Trump made numerous interjections that read as chaotic. In turn, Biden was seen to come out on top.\n\nHowever, the Harris campaign\u2019s request to keep Trump\u2019s microphone unmuted was ultimately denied.\n\nMatthew Levendusky, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said another Harris priority will be to use the debate stage to establish herself with the US public.\n\nHarris only launched her presidential campaign seven weeks ago. She has therefore had far less time in the national spotlight than Trump.\n\nBut critics point to her past debate performances as a positive sign going into Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, for instance, Harris took part in Democratic presidential primary debates, and she generated buzz for landing successful punches on her future boss Biden.\n\nShe also excelled in a policy-heavy vice presidential debate against Mike Pence during the general election that same year.\n\nHarris \u2014 the former district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California \u2014 has a prosecutorial style, something she exercised during her time in the Senate. Her hard-knuckle questions during Senate committee hearings gained her a national profile.\n\nLevendusky said Harris will aim to reprise that role on Tuesday\u2019s debate stage. She will be \u201clooking to come off as tough and grill Trump and show that she can rebut him\u201d, he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBut of course, the danger for her is that, as a woman of colour, she\u2019s in a tough position given race and gender stereotypes about appropriate behaviour,\u201d Levendusky added. \u201cSo far, she seems to be very effectively managing that tightrope, and this is her chance to highlight these skills on an even larger stage.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u2018sixth sense\u2019\n\nTrump, meanwhile, will be making his seventh appearance in a general election debate \u2014 more than any candidate in US history.\n\nHe continues to be powered by one entrenched factor, according to Perry: He seems impervious to the standards applied to other candidates and their behaviour. His base will support him no matter what.\n\n\u201cWhatever rules there were have become immaterial to him,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be pinned down, and he can\u2019t be countered, because it doesn\u2019t matter to the people who are locked into voting for him.\u201d\n\nBut experts like Perry warn that Trump needs to expand his appeal beyond his base in order to win the election this November.\n\nPerry pointed out that Trump only won the presidency in 2016 thanks to the Electoral College, a system of weighted voting where \u201celectors\u201d are awarded based on state election results. The candidate who wins the most votes in a given state often wins all of that state\u2019s electors.\n\nIn both 2016 and 2020, however, Trump lost the national popular vote \u2014 earning fewer votes overall than his Democratic rivals in each case.\n\nThat means Trump still needs to attract voters outside of his staunchest base to ensure victory, according to Perry.\n\nOn the debate stage, Trump \u2014 a former reality TV star \u2014 excels at being a \u201cmoving target\u201d, according to Kall. The Republican has a knack for traipsing through tangents and launching non-sequitur attacks that can be confounding to opponents.\n\nKall pointed out that Trump\u2019s unpredictable debate performances in 2016 proved to be jet fuel for his meteoric rise in politics.\n\nAnd Trump continues to show uncanny instincts when it comes to capitalising on camera-ready, politically significant moments, as evidenced by his defiant fist pump following an assassination attempt in July, Kall said.\n\n\u201cHe made sure the image that was captured was most politically advantageous to him,\u201d Kall explained. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in debates. He has a spidery sixth sense of knowing when there is a key exchange or moment in a debate that everyone\u2019s going to be talking about and could potentially go viral.\u201d\n\nDifferences in preparation\n\nThe lead-up to the debate has also offered an indication of how each candidate may react on the debate stage.\n\nTheir preparation methods reveal a counterpoint in style. Trump has continued to eschew traditional debate preparation for more free-wheeling policy discussions with staffers, according to media reports.\n\nBut Harris has stationed herself in Pennsylvania to practice with mock debates, using a Trump stand-in just as Biden had in the past.\n\nNevertheless, Trump has reportedly tapped Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, to help with his debate preparation. Critics say Gabbard showed a unique ability to shake Harris on the debate stage during the 2020 Democratic primaries.\n\nAt 78, Trump\u2019s advanced age could also be a liability as he faces the 59-year-old Harris. It will be the first time he has publicly grappled with a considerably younger debate opponent in years.\n\nLevendusky pointed out that Trump\u2019s blustery, unrehearsed style has been a double-edged sword \u2014 one that could alienate viewers as much as attract them.\n\n\u201cFor Trump, he wants to do something to disrupt the narrative and take back control of the news cycle,\u201d Levendusky explained. \u201cBut his risk is that he falls into his traditional pattern and that reminds voters of what they disliked about him.\u201d\n\n\u2018Stereotypical tropes\u2019\n\nThe experts who spoke to Al Jazeera also warned that Trump\u2019s approach to his rival\u2019s gender and race could also prove divisive during the debate.\n\nHarris is only the second woman ever to lead a major party\u2019s presidential ticket after Democrat Hillary Clinton faced Trump in 2016. She is also the first Black woman and South Asian woman to lead the party.\n\nOn the debate stage, Harris will deal with societal preconceptions that Trump does not have to contend with, according to Kelly Dittmar, the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University-Camden.\n\n\u201cHarris, I\u2019m sure, is being advised in relation to things like tone and showing emotion and reaction to Trump\u2019s types of goading,\u201d Dittmar told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBecause women are more often subjected to claims that they\u2019re overly emotional. There are stereotypical tropes of Black women being angry that she is surely aware of, and you can see evidence in the way that she, very calmly, often in these types of settings, responds.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has leaned into sexist attacks throughout his political career, repeatedly labelling Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d and looming behind her during a debate in 2016.\n\nHe also infamously said that Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever\u201d following a Republican primary debate.\n\nDittmar noted that Trump has continued that line of attack with Harris, using gender-coded insults. He has, for example, called Harris \u201cincompetent\u201d, ridiculed her laugh and commented on her physical appearance.\n\nWhether he continues to do so on the debate stage will be an indicator of which audience he seeks to rally.\n\n\u201cLeaning into the hyper-masculinity, the more aggressive approach that he has taken in previous debates, that\u2019s going to land better among his existing base,\u201d Dittmar explained.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, if he is trying to engage and gain back any support from voters who are \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 in the middle, you would see him strategically try to emphasise policy differences over that personal kind of rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s unclear if he can stick to that,\u201d Dittmar added.\n\nThe challenge for Harris, Dittmar said, is to remain unflappable when faced with Trump\u2019s remarks. But she believes Harris has already shown her steady stage presence through her time as a prosecutor and in the Senate.\n\nMaintaining that same level-headed persona during the debate could boost Harris\u2019s chances in the November race.\n\n\u201cPeople typically look for leaders who can be unrattled by these high-pressure moments,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cThat is somewhere that we already know Harris excels and can it translate into a perception that she is presidential.\u201d"

            "text": "This was always a ridiculous idea. Yes, The New York Times has its flaws. But read its staff editorials\u2014it is certainly not in the tank for Trump. Instead, the Biden campaign was guided by a premise that is hostile to the very practice of journalism: that the threat Trump poses to the country means that any scrutiny of Biden was unwarranted and unfair. Biden wasn\u2019t being hidden from the press because he was old but because his advisers were engaged in a self-destructive feud with the media. That feud has continued now that Harris is the nominee.\n\nThis is troubling in and of itself. But it\u2019s also troubling because it suggests that the people running the Biden campaign still have influence in the Harris campaign. They shouldn\u2019t. They ran the most inept reelection campaign in recent memory, one that was racing toward a Trump landslide. None of these people have any business being anywhere near an election that\u2019s this consequential. Instead, they\u2019re using the same silly ideas\u2014the Times is out to get Harris!\u2014to guide their decisions, embracing sycophants, TikTokers, and YouTubers while hiding their intelligent candidate from intelligent reporters at major outlets that are followed by millions of intelligent voters. So who, exactly, is insulting whom here?\n\n\n\nHarris is more than capable of talking to the press and taking clear stances on issues (even if she\u2019s developing a habit of changing her mind, even on issues that almost no one is talking about). She should talk to the press more. She should do it to show that she can run the country, which she can. She should do it to show that she understands policy, which she does. She should do it because it will generate media attention that will almost certainly benefit her campaign. But she should also do it to show that she isn\u2019t just running the same campaign that was losing handily to Trump six weeks ago. Because right now, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing.\n\n"

Of course, follow-ups to gags can be tricky, especially in comedy sequels. Some try to go bigger and wilder, such as the climactic news team battle in \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.\" Others try and undercut or subvert the expectation, like when Phoebe Cates' Kate starts delivering a monologue about some trauma that happened to her on Lincoln's birthday and is cut off in \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch.\" Others still merely pick up where the bit left off in the first film, as with the \"concealed nudity\" sequences in the \"Austin Powers\" sequels.\n\nFor \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,\" director Tim Burton approached the dilemma in much the same way he approached the rest of the film, or for that matter, the way he's approached all his work: by simply doing what struck him as interesting and correct for the moment. Burton's films may be varied when it comes to their reception by audiences and fans, but he's always consistently followed his own muse, for better or worse, and his approach to sequels is no different. With that in mind, Burton has long expressed an affection for kitsch, especially when it comes to needle drops in his films. From the Belafonte in \"Beetlejuice\" to Tom Jones in \"Edward Scissorhands\" and \"Mars Attacks\" to scoring a fight scene in \"Dark Shadows\" to Barry White, Burton loves a good ironic music cue. As such, it's no surprise that \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" follows up \"Day-O\" with a song that might rank as the most kitschy pop single ever released: \"MacArthur Park.\""

            "headline": "New Poll Suggests Harris's Support Has Stalled After Euphoric August...",
            "text": "Is Kamala Harris\u2019s surge beginning to ebb?\n\nThat\u2019s the question raised by this morning\u2019s New York Times/Siena College poll, which finds Donald J. Trump narrowly ahead of her among likely voters nationwide, 48 percent to 47 percent.\n\nTo me, the result is a bit surprising. It\u2019s the first lead for Mr. Trump in a major nonpartisan national survey in about a month. As a result, it\u2019s worth being at least a little cautious about these findings, as there isn\u2019t much confirmation from other polls.\n\nThat said, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to explain if Vice President Harris\u2019s support really has faded a bit in recent weeks. After all, she was benefiting from an ideal news environment: an uninterrupted month of glowing coverage from President Biden\u2019s departure from the race in July to the Democratic convention in August. It\u2019s possible she was riding a political sugar high; if so, it would make sense if she came off those highs in the two uneventful weeks since the convention.\n\nThere\u2019s also a plausible reason the Times/Siena poll would be the first to capture a shift back toward Mr. Trump: There simply haven\u2019t been many high-quality surveys fielded since the convention, when Ms. Harris was riding high. There was a scattering of online polls this week, but there hasn\u2019t been a traditional high-quality survey with interviews conducted after Aug. 28.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t there been more polls? One explanation is Labor Day weekend, which always puts a pause on polling. It\u2019s also plausible that many pollsters might prefer to wait until after the debate Tuesday before taking another poll. Whatever the explanation, the Times/Siena poll would be one of the first opportunities to pick up a reversion back toward Mr. Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s advantages\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know whether the Times/Siena poll is too favorable for Mr. Trump. We never know whether the polls are \u201cright\u201d until the votes are counted.\n\nBut the poll nonetheless finds that he has significant advantages in this election \u2014 and they might just be enough to put him over the top.\n\nHe\u2019s more popular than before. Overall, 46 percent of likely voters say they have a favorable view of the former president. That\u2019s down a tick from our last national poll, when 47 percent had a favorable view, but it still makes him more popular than he was in 2016 or 2020.\n\nHe has an advantage on the issues. We asked voters a two-part question. First, what\u2019s the most important issue to your vote? Second, do you think Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump is better on that issue? By that measure, Mr. Trump has a five-point lead on the issue that matters most to voters, whatever that may be for them.\n\nHe occupies the center. A near majority of voters say Mr. Trump is \u201cnot too far\u201d to the left or right on the issues, while only around one-third say he\u2019s \u201ctoo far to the right.\u201d Nearly half of voters, in contrast, say Ms. Harris is too far to the left; only 41 percent say she\u2019s \u201cnot too far either way.\u201d\n\nThis is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s overlooked advantages. Yes, he\u2019s outside of the political mainstream in many respects \u2014 he denied the result of the 2020 election. And yes, he does have conservative views on many issues, like immigration. But he\u2019s also taken many positions that would have been likelier to be held by a Democrat than a Republican a decade ago, like opposition to cutting entitlements, support for a cooperative relationship with Russia or opposition to free trade. It\u2019s a reputation he\u2019s careful to protect, from saying he doesn\u2019t support Project 2025 to his cagey position on additional measures to restrict abortion.\n\nHe\u2019s seen as the change candidate in a nation that wants change. While President Biden\u2019s departure from the race lifted the spirits of many Democrats, the national mood still isn\u2019t great. An overwhelming majority of voters still say that the economy is poor and that the nation is heading in the wrong direction. And a clear majority \u2014 61 percent \u2014 of voters say they want the next president to bring a \u201cmajor change\u201d from Mr. Biden, compared with 34 percent who want \u201cminor change\u201d and 3 percent who don\u2019t want change.\n\nWhich candidate represents change in this election? While that has been hotly debated since Ms. Harris\u2019s entry into the race, the respondents to the Times/Siena poll say it\u2019s Mr. Trump.\n\nOnly 40 percent of likely voters said Ms. Harris represented \u201cchange,\u201d while 55 percent said she represented \u201cmore of the same.\u201d Mr. Trump, in contrast, was seen as representing \u201cchange\u201d by 61 percent of voters, while only 34 percent said he was \u201cmore of the same.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, of course, has plenty of political weaknesses. A majority of voters still view him unfavorably \u2014 as they always have \u2014 and say he\u2019s a \u201crisky choice\u201d for president. Abortion, democracy and Project 2025 all stand out as major liabilities in the poll.\n\nBut at least in this poll, Mr. Trump leads anyway. Worse for Ms. Harris, she is seen as having few strengths.\n\nIs Harris getting defined?\n\nWhen Ms. Harris entered the presidential race, she seemed like a candidate with a lot of potential liabilities. She took many unpopular positions in her 2019 presidential campaign, and she was tied to the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policy as well.\n\nIn August, it seemed she could glide past all of these issues by running as a \u201cgeneric\u201d Democrat. She didn\u2019t make many gestures to the middle. She didn\u2019t roll out a robust policy platform. Instead, she mostly stuck to boilerplate Democratic messaging on abortion, strengthening the middle class, prices, democracy and more.\n\nThe advantage of this approach was obvious: A \u201cgeneric\u201d Democrat is often a winning one. The risk, however, was that Ms. Harris was inevitably going to be defined, one way or another, and that her campaign was mostly forfeiting its opportunity to clearly define her in the eyes of the public.\n\nIn this poll, the risks associated with this strategy are evident. Despite a month of favorable coverage, voters still don\u2019t know enough about her: 28 percent of voters said they needed to learn more, compared with only 9 percent who said the same about Mr. Trump. More than anything, voters say they want to hear more about where she stands on the issues, something her campaign has seemed to struggled to lay out.\n\nThe poll also hints that the Trump campaign has begun to fill in some of the blanks. Nearly half of voters say she\u2019s \u201ctoo liberal or progressive.\u201d A majority of voters see her as at least somewhat responsible for the problems along the border. And a majority of voters say she\u2019s a \u201crisky\u201d choice and \u201cmore of the same\u201d \u2014 hardly an enviable combination.\n\nMs. Harris, of course, will have plenty of additional opportunities to define herself for voters, beginning with the debate on Tuesday.\n\nThe post New Poll Suggests Harris\u2019s Support Has Stalled After a Euphoric August appeared first on New York Times."

Vladimir Poutine a fait savoir, non sans humour, qu\u2019il soutenait Kamala Harris pour l\u2019\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle am\u00e9ricaine de novembre 2024. Et cette annonce surprenante n\u2019a pas plu au candidat r\u00e9publicain, qui s\u2019est dit \u00ab vex\u00e9 \u00bb, comme vous pouvez le voir dans notre vid\u00e9o ci-dessus.\n\nLire aussi Pour la pr\u00e9sidentielle am\u00e9ricaine, Vladimir Poutine annonce soutenir Kamala Harris\n\nLe 5 septembre dernier, lors d\u2019un forum \u00e9conomique \u00e0 Vladivostok en Russie, Vladimir Poutine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab Je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, le favori, si je puis dire, \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident en exercice, M.

Et si Mme Harris se porte bien, peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019elle s\u2019abstiendra de faire quelque chose de ce genre \u00bb, a-t-il ajout\u00e9.\n\nCe soutien surprise n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le bienvenu pour Kamala Harris et Joe Biden. Le porte-parole du Conseil de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale de la Maison Blanche, John Kirby, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab Nous appr\u00e9cierons grandement que Vladimir Poutine, petit a : arr\u00eate de parler de notre \u00e9lection, et, petit b : arr\u00eate de s\u2019en m\u00ealer \u00bb.\n\nDonald Trump n\u2019a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le tacle de Poutine\n\nDeux jours plus tard samedi 7 septembre, lors d\u2019un rally \u00e0 Mosinee dans l\u2019\u00c9tat disput\u00e9 du Wisconsin, Donald Trump a r\u00e9agi aux r\u00e9flexions de Vladimir Poutine. \u00ab La Russie n\u2019aurait jamais eu lieu si j\u2019\u00e9tais pr\u00e9sident.

In 2016, Bush left the presidential ballot blank, according to his spokesperson. His father, President George H.W.

Alle Meldungen zur US-Wahl im Ticker.\n\n\u00dcberraschende Wende kurz vor TV-Duell: Trump in Umfrage knapp vor Harris\n\n17.30 Uhr: Knapp zwei Monate vor der US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl liefern sich Kamala Harris und Donald Trump einer neuen Umfrage zufolge weiter ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen. Landesweit k\u00e4me der republikanische Ex-Pr\u00e4sident derzeit auf 48 Prozent, berichtete die \u201eNew York Times\u201c am Sonntag unter Berufung auf das Institut Siena. Die Demokratin Harris liege bei 47 Prozent. Allerdings betont die Zeitung, dass die m\u00f6gliche Abweichungsrate bei der Umfrage h\u00f6her liegt als der ermittelte ein Prozentpunkt Unterschied.\n\nIn den USA ist wegen des Wahlsystems die landesweite Gesamtzahl der Stimmen aber nicht in erster Linie entscheidend. Vielmehr kommt es auf die sogenannten Swing States an - also Bundesstaaten, in denen das Rennen zwischen Demokraten und Republikanern besonders eng ist. Der Umfrage zufolge liegt Harris dabei derzeit ganz knapp in Wisconsin, Michigan und Pennsylvania vorn. In vier weiteren Swing States - Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina und Arizona - herrsche derzeit ein Unentschieden.\n\nBeide Lager schauen nun mit Spannung auf das am Dienstag stattfindende TV-Duell zwischen der 59-j\u00e4hrigen Harris und dem 78-j\u00e4hrigen Trump. Dabei steht viel auf dem Spiel, manche TV-Duelle haben US-Wahlen entschieden. Aussetzer oder Fehler k\u00f6nnen verheerende Folgen haben - im Fall des scheidenden Amtsinhabers Joe Biden bedeutete seine Fehlleistung im Duell mit Trump am 27.

            "headline": "Donald Trump often steals the show, but this debate spotlight will more likely be on Kamala Harris",
            "text": "For Kamala Harris, Tuesday night's presidential debate with former U.S. president Donald Trump could be a significant moment of opportunity for the vice-president, but also, perhaps, a significant risk.\n\n\"I do think this is a debate about Kamala Harris more than it's a debate about Trump,\" said Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus at Northeastern University's school of journalism, and an expert on presidential debates.\n\nWith Trump such a known commodity, the debate \u2014 the first and possibly only contest between the two current candidates \u2014 could offer Harris the occasion to grow her level of support. On the flip side, she could alienate voters if she does not perform well.\n\n\"Trump has been so dominant on the American political stage for the past decade, really,\" Schroeder said. \"And now it's about someone else.\"\n\nTrump won't have Biden as distraction\n\nThat could be an advantage for Harris, says Schroeder, because there will be more attention on her. But it also means more pressure and \"the absolute need for her to have a successful debate, in order to capitalize on this momentum.\"\n\nBut for Trump, experts say a poor performance \u2014 which may include his habits of avoiding answering questions, making false statements and repeating personal attacks he's made against Harris on the campaign trail \u2014 could have more resonance this time without the distraction that President Joe Biden's performance provided last time.\n\n\"Biden was so awful that it actually overwhelmed the fact that Trump did not have a good debate performance either,\" said Patrick A. Stewart, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, and the author of The Audience Decides: Applause-Cheering, Laughter, and Booing during Debates in the Trump Era.\n\nWATCH | Key moments from the Trump-Biden debate: Key moments from the Biden-Trump debate Duration 2:58 U.S. President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump squared off in a debate in Atlanta that aired on CNN. Here are some of the major moments \u2014 including when Trump took advantage of a verbal fumble from Biden, as well as the current president accusing his predecessor of having 'the morals of an alley cat' regarding his ongoing criminal and civil legal issues.\n\nStewart also believes Trump, who has \"never been a policy guy,\" may also be judged on whether he still has the same vigour he's had in prior debates.\n\n\"Is it still the Trump that we know from back in 2016 and 2020 where he was sharp, was on his game as far as verbally being able to come at people and verbally attack them,\" he said. \"Or will he have lost a little bit of steam?\"\n\nThe debate, which is scheduled for Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET, is expected to last 90 minutes and is being moderated by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, with no studio audience.\n\nCross Country Checkup is asking: Why does the Trump-Harris debate matter to you? What will you be watching for? Fill out this form and you could appear on the show or have your comment read on air.\n\nIt may not have the same immediate impact as Trump's debate against Biden, whose poor performance raised questions about his cognitive abilities, and eventually led to him stepping down as the Democratic presidential candidate before being replaced by Harris.\n\nStill, with polls suggesting the race is tied, either candidate's debate performance could move the needle among those undecided voters who will be key in determining the outcome of the election.\n\n\"I think this will be sort of a big, marquee moment for people to begin to arrive at a decision,\" Schroeder said.\n\nWATCH | Harris and Trump prepare for the upcoming debate: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris gear up for Sept. 10 debate Duration 47:02 A jam-packed summer in U.S. politics comes to a close as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump officially confirmed their places on the Nov. 5 presidential ballot. Power & Politics does a deep dive into the U.S. election and looks ahead to their Sept. 10 debate.\n\nHarris may focus on Trump policy failures, abortion\n\nFor weeks, Harris has reportedly been preparing for this debate, which has included mock debate sessions. She's expected to focus on what her team perceives as Trump's policy failures as president, which include the U.S. border wall, infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuters reported.\n\nShe may also focus on abortion and the reversal of Roe v. Wade during Trump's presidency, an issue widely perceived as a liability for Republicans and Trump, whose U.S. Supreme Court appointments led to the reversal.\n\nRobert Rowland, a professor of rhetoric and political communication at the University of Kansas, says that along with some policies, predicts Harris will also focus on suggesting Trump is a \"scam artist\" who \"doesn't care about ordinary people.\"\n\nIn Harris, Trump will be facing a opponent known for her discipline, something she's shown on the campaign trail by sticking to the same talking points. A potential weakness for Trump during the debate, some experts say, is his tendency to engage in rambling, stream of consciousness answers that touch on a variety of subjects \u2014 something he has recently boasted about and referred to as \"the weave.\"\n\nBut Harris herself has been criticized for some of her own rambling answers during events, or as noted by the New York Times following her CNN interview, \"she can sometimes deliver discursive answers that ramble and zigzag.\"\n\nStewart suggested Harris is also at a disadvantage in that she hasn't yet had a full vetting and \"really hasn't faced any individuals up until this point\" in the campaign.\n\nHarris 'can't show any nerves'\n\nWhile Harris has been involved in other debates, including those in the 2020 Democratic primaries and a vice-presidential debate, this will be her biggest audience yet. Schroeder points out this debate will be in a different league, and Trump has experienced such debates six times.\n\n\"I think inexperience at that level, playing the game at this level, is something that is really hard to do,\" he said. \"I think she can't show any nerves. She can't show any sign of intimidation or fear on that stage.\"\n\nHarris has also only faced one sit-down interview since being named a candidate, meaning she will need to be prepared to face attacks by Trump, but also questions from the debate moderators.\n\nWATCH | Harris talks policy, cabinet plans in 1st big interview: Kamala Harris talks policy, cabinet plans in 1st big interview Duration 3:03 In the first big interview of her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris told CNN she plans to put a Republican in her cabinet. She also defended the current U.S. policy surrounding the Gaza war, and laid out her plans to tackle affordability.\n\nThose questions will likely include topics such as the Biden administration's record and accusations of flip-flopping on some key policy initiatives. For example, she has previously indicated support for a ban on fracking and the decriminalization of illegal border-crossings, but she and her campaign have said that she no longer holds those views.\n\n\"She's going to be challenged on not only her previous record, but [the] Biden administration record in general,\" Schroeder said. \"It'll be interesting to see how she deals with that.\"\n\nIt's that record, Republican operatives have suggested, that Trump needs to focus on, to try to rattler her on policy.\n\n\"But that's not Trump's strong point,\" said Stewart.\n\n'Trump's gonna Trump'\n\nMarc Thiessen, a speechwriter for former U.S. president George W. Bush, wrote in a column for the Washington Post that Trump needs to take advantage of the fact that many undecided voters don't like the direction of the country.\n\nAnd Trump needs to remind voters of the policies that were popular during his administration, Thiessen wrote.\n\nHe also said Trump needs to tie Harris to parts of Biden's record that remain unpopular, such as the spike in inflation, as well as zeroing in on Harris's flip-flops. He must also avoid reminding voters about why many people don't like him, which would also mean avoiding personal attacks on Harris.\n\n\"With one disciplined debate performance, Trump helped knock Biden out of the race. On Tuesday night, he has a chance to do the same to Harris,\" Thiessen wrote.\n\nWATCH | How both candidates are courting the working class: How are Trump, Harris courting the U.S. working-class vote? | Canada Tonight Duration 13:46 Thomas Frank, political analyst and historian, talks about how both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are trying to win the working-class vote in the U.S., and how the upcoming Sept. 10 presidential debate could be as consequential as the last.\n\nYet that suggests some kind of strategy on Trump's part \u2014 something he hasn't appeared to have used in previous debates, according to Schroeder.\n\n\"He doesn't really go in with a game plan. He doesn't work on specific lines or specific lines of attack,\" Schroeder said. \"He doesn't seem to be able to tailor an argument against a particular candidate. It's always just to strafe them with as much ammo as he can.\"\n\nRowland says Trump only has one style, and that since it's not focused on the issues, he's able to use it regardless of the questions.\n\n\"The disadvantage is, there's a point where he offends people,\" he said.\n\n\"Most of that is baked in. But I think, with college educated women especially, it's going to remind them why they voted against him in the last election.\"\n\nTrump focusing on specific policies instead of going for the personal attack would show a \"level of growth,\" according to Stewart, who says he's not expecting that.\n\n\"Trump's gonna Trump,\" Rowland said.\n\n\"The one thing that would throw him off his game is if she just maintains an even keel.\""

Harris kann beim TV-Duell aus Clintons Fehlern lernen, denn diese gibt ihr Tipps im Umgang mit dem Rivalen.\n\nDie fr\u00fchere US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton hat ihre TV-Duelle gegen den Republikaner Donald Trump in nicht so guter Erinnerung: 2016 trat Clinton in der US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl gegen den republikanischen Kandidaten Trump an. Daf\u00fcr stellte sie sich ihrem Rivalen mehrfach im TV-Duell. Die Fernsehdebatten formten damals auch den Blick der W\u00e4hler auf Trump als Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten.\n\n\"Der Konsens war, dass ich alle drei Debatten gewonnen habe und dass ich gut vorbereitet war\", sagt 76-j\u00e4hrige Clinton der \"New York Times\". Trotzdem verlor sie gegen Trump - eine Niederlage, die die Demokraten bis heute pr\u00e4gt.\n\nSchon bei der ersten TV-Debatte habe Trump sie verspottet und sich vor mehr als 85 Zuschauern \u00fcber sie lustig gemacht. Clinton zufolge ist die richtige Vorbereitung der Schl\u00fcssel, um Trump rhetorisch zur\u00fcckzudr\u00e4ngen.\n\n\"Gut ger\u00fcstet\" in die Fernsehschlacht\n\nHarris m\u00fcsse so gut vorbereitet sein, dass sie sich sowohl in der Offensive als auch in der Defensive gegen Trump bestehen k\u00f6nne, so Clinton. Es gebe viel zu besprechen, f\u00fcgt Clinton hinzu. Die Ehefrau des ehemaligen US-Pr\u00e4sidenten Bill Clinton geht laut der \"New York Times\" davon aus, dass ihre Parteikollegin Kamala Harris, Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin der Demokraten, gut vorbereitet in die TV-Debatte geht.\n\nParteifreundinnen: Kamala Harris, Kathy Hochul und Hillary Clinton 2022 in New York. (Foto: picture alliance / ZUMAPRESS.com)\n\nDie 59-j\u00e4hrige Harris habe in der Vergangenheit schon oft bewiesen, dass sie eine gute Debattiererin sei. \"Und ich denke, dass sie aufgrund ihrer Erfahrung als Staatsanw\u00e4ltin gut daf\u00fcr ger\u00fcstet ist\", sagt Clinton. Beispielhaft nennt Clinton Harris' Senatskandidatur f\u00fcr Kalifornien oder auch die TV-Debatten der Vize-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten im Wahlkampf 2020, bei denen Harris Mike Pence die Stirn bot. Clinton sagt, dass Trump seine \"\u00fcbliche Strategie\" fahren und versuchen w\u00fcrde, auch Harris bei der TV-Debatte kleinzureden. Dabei gehe er nicht auf Fragen ein.\n\nDie Ex-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin r\u00e4t Harris, Trump mit seinen eigenen Aussagen zu konfrontieren. Harris solle Trump \"seine wirklich schreckliche Bilanz als Pr\u00e4sident vorhalten\", sagt Clinton. Zudem solle Harris seine Verbindung zum \"Projekt 25\" offen ansprechen. Damit habe Harris eine Menge gute Munition.\n\nZiel: Zweifel an Trump sch\u00fcren\n\nVor der TV-Debatte habe Clinton mit Harris \u00fcber eine Reihe von Dingen gesprochen. \"Sie sollte sich einfach nicht k\u00f6dern lassen. Sie sollte ihn k\u00f6dern. Er kann verunsichert werden\", sagt Clinton und genau das gebe Harris' eine Angriffsfl\u00e4che. Beispielhaft zieht Clinton daf\u00fcr ihr TV-Duell mit Trump heran. Als Clinton sagte, Trump sei eine russische Marionette, habe er auf der B\u00fchne angefangen zu stottern. Das ist Clinton zufolge ein Beispiel daf\u00fcr, wie Trump verunsichert werden k\u00f6nne. Trump wisse nicht, wie er auf substanzielle, direkte Angriffe reagieren solle, so Clinton weiter.\n\nJe mehr Trump und seine Aussagen auf der B\u00fchne entlarvt werden w\u00fcrden, desto mehr Menschen w\u00fcrden schlie\u00dflich auch an Trump als Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidat zweifeln. \"Und genau das soll die Debatte bewirken\", sagt Clinton. Es gehe auch darum, die noch unentschlossenen W\u00e4hler zu \u00fcberzeugen.\n\nAm 10. September (Ortszeit/11. September MESZ) treten Trump und Harris im laufenden Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlkampf erstmals in einer TV-Debatte gegeneinander an. Veranstalter ist der Sender ABC. Das TV-Duell der beiden Vize-Kandidaten. J.D. Vance und Tim Walz findet am 1. Oktober statt und wird von CBS veranstaltet."

            "text": "Das Maduro-Regime sitzt nach dem offensichtlichen Wahlbetrug fester im Sattel als von vielen erhofft. Inzwischen erw\u00e4gen Millionen Venezolaner, ihre Heimat zu verlassen \u2013 auch in Richtung USA. F\u00fcr den US-Wahlkampf k\u00f6nnte das noch entscheidende Konsequenzen haben.\n\nAnzeige\n\nGerade einmal 18.000 Einwohner z\u00e4hlt das kleine St\u00e4dtchen Paracaima im Norden Brasiliens. Inzwischen kommen t\u00e4glich ein paar Hundert dazu. Wieder einmal. Die Internationale Organisation f\u00fcr Migration (IOM) meldete, dass der 26. August der Tag mit der h\u00f6chsten Zahl von Grenz\u00fcbertritten durch Migranten aus dem Nachbarland Venezuela seit den Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen Ende Juli gewesen sei. Allein an diesem Donnerstag seien 744 Menschen eingereist, 589 von ihnen baten um Schutz. \u00c4hnliches ist aus der ostkolumbianischen Grenzstadt Cucuta zu h\u00f6ren. T\u00e4glich \u00fcberqueren nach Angaben der kolumbianisch-venezolanischen NGO \u201eFundacion Nueva Ilusi\u00f3n\u201c 140 bis 160 Venezolaner die Grenze. Das sozialistische Regime in Venezuela lasse durch ihm nahestehende paramilit\u00e4rische Schl\u00e4gertrupps in Kolumbien die Unterk\u00fcnfte von Regierungskritikern markieren, um diese sp\u00e4ter ausfindig machen zu k\u00f6nnen, sagt eine NGO-Sprecherin. Wie viele tats\u00e4chlich ihre Heimat verlassen, ist schwer einzusch\u00e4tzen, denn inzwischen versuchen es viele Venezolaner \u00fcber die gr\u00fcne Grenze nach Kolumbien.\n\nAnzeige\n\nDiese Entwicklung wird nun zu einem echten H\u00e4rtetest f\u00fcr die US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Kamala Harris. Sie muss mitten Wahlkampf in der unkalkulierbaren Venezuela-Krise F\u00fchrungsst\u00e4rke beweisen. Als neues Gesicht der demokratischen Regierung steht Harris unter Druck, eine erneute Migrationswelle zur US-Grenze zu verhindern und sich gleichzeitig die immer wichtiger werdenden Stimmen der US-Latinos zu sichern, die rund 19 Prozent der US-Bev\u00f6lkerung stellen. Das wird aber nur mit einem klaren Konzept und erkennbaren Fortschritten zur L\u00f6sung der Krise gelingen.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl Welche globalen Trends f\u00fcr einen Sieg von Trump sprechen \u2013 und welche f\u00fcr Harris\n\nVenezuelas Oppositionsf\u00fchrerin Maria Corina Machado stellt klare Forderungen an die Biden-Harris-Administration. Die Regierung und beide Parteien im Kongress h\u00e4tten die M\u00f6glichkeit, der freien Welt ihre Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit demonstrieren, sagte Machado in einer Online-Pressekonferenz mit ausl\u00e4ndischen Journalisten.\n\nAnzeige\n\n\u201eWenn ein Konflikt nicht gel\u00f6st werden kann, der so tiefgreifend und dringlich ist, dass er eine Gefahr f\u00fcr diese Hemisph\u00e4re darstellt, dann ist es h\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich, dass auch andere, weiter entfernte Konflikte gel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnen.\u201c Die Migration bedrohe heute die Gesellschaften, daher m\u00fcssten deren Ursachen beseitigt werden. \u201eUnd die Ursache ist das Maduro-Regime.

Zwar versuchen ihr die Republikaner mehr denn je, die Verantwortung f\u00fcr Migrationskontrolle und Grenzmanagement der US-Regierung aufzuerlegen und labelten die Demokratin als \u201eGrenz-Zarin\u201c. Tats\u00e4chlich aber hat die Demokratin seit 2021 lediglich den Auftrag, jene diplomatischen Bem\u00fchungen zu leiten, durch die Fluchtursachen im L\u00e4nderdreieck Guatemala-Honduras-El Salvador sowie Mexiko bek\u00e4mpft werden. Oppositionskandidat nach Spanien geflohen Der venezolanische Diktator und Wahlbetr\u00fcger Nicol\u00e1s Maduro baut derweil weiter indirekt Druck auf die Biden-Harris-Regierung auf. Am Montag erlie\u00df die von Maduro kontrollierte Staatsanwaltschaft des Landes einen Haftbefehl gegen den eigentlichen Wahlsieger Edmundo Gonzalez. Vorwurf: Missachtung von Gesetzen, Verschw\u00f6rung und Sabotage. Wenige Tage sp\u00e4ter ist der Oppositionspolitiker aus Venezuela geflohen und hat Asyl in Spanien beantragt. Harris\u2018 Gegenspieler Trump warf ihr zuletzt vor, durch eine Lockerung der US-Sanktionen im Vorfeld der Wahlen das Regime in Caracas gest\u00e4rkt zu haben. Tats\u00e4chlich waren Sanktionen gegen die venezolanische \u00d6lindustrie im vergangenen Oktober als Reaktion auf eine Vereinbarung zwischen Maduro und den Oppositionsparteien weitgehend gelockert worden. Im April hatten die USA die Sanktionen wieder in Kraft gesetzt, nachdem klar wurde, dass Maduro seine Wahlversprechen nicht eingehalten zu haben. Nach vierj\u00e4hriger Funkstille steigen die \u00d6limporte seit 2023 wieder an und erreichten im Mai 2024 mit 241.000 Barrel pro Tag den h\u00f6chsten Stand seit 2019.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahlkampf So positionieren sich Kamala Harris und Donald Trump bei den wichtigsten Themen\n\nVenezuelas linksextremer Machthaber lie\u00df sich Ende Juli durch von ihm kontrollierte Institutionen zum Sieger erkl\u00e4ren, obwohl er nach Einsch\u00e4tzungen unabh\u00e4ngiger Wahlbeobachter die Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen klar verloren hatte. Er wird von den meisten lateinamerikanischen L\u00e4ndern nicht als Wahlsieger anerkannt, die EU und die USA verweigern Maduro wegen des offensichtlichen Wahlbetruges die Anerkennung. Russland, China, der Iran, Nordkorea und die beiden anderen lateinamerikanischen Linksdiktaturen Kuba und Nicaragua gratulierten Maduro dagegen zum Sieg. Mehr als einen Monat nach der Wahl in Venezuela sind die Vorboten eines neuen Massenexodus \u00fcberall zu sp\u00fcren. Laut Umfragen erw\u00e4gen 40 Prozent der noch im Land lebenden Venezolaner nach dem Wahlbetrug und der damit verbundenen Perspektivlosigkeit ihre Koffer zu packen. Das w\u00e4re ein Migrationspotential von weiteren elf Millionen Menschen. Die meisten bleiben erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df in Lateinamerika, doch Venezolaner geh\u00f6ren mittlerweile auch zu den gr\u00f6\u00dften Herkunftsl\u00e4ndern von Migranten, die den Grenz\u00fcbertritt in die USA versuchen. 2023 waren sie nach US-Angaben sogar die Gruppe mit den meisten versuchten illegalen Grenz\u00fcbertritten.

            "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Though Conclave is fiction based on the Robert Harris novel, you cannot watch Edward Berger\u2019s taut thriller about the election of a new pope without noticing the parallels to the polarizing politics of the race for the White House. The surprise twists and turns abound as it becomes clear the Vatican will either retreat into past conservative, exclusionary policies, or embrace Catholics who\u2019ve been excluded by the institution. The German-born filmmaker is introducing his follow-up to the harrowing WWI drama All Quiet on the Western Front, which won four Oscars including Best International Film. This one-two punch also announces a major filmmaking talent, though he\u2019s no overnight success. Whether he moves on to a major studio franchise like Ocean\u2019s 14 or 007, it is clear from the confident hand in his visual storytelling that Berger is a filmmaker who can make the kind of impact in sophisticated commercial fare as a Sam Mendes or Christopher Nolan. Here, Berger introduces himself to Deadline readers to position Conclave \u2013 which Focus Features launches in awards season \u2013 and discusses many other things. Ralph Fiennes (already generating strong Oscar buzz), Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Isabella Rossellini star in a film that made its Toronto debut this morning and screens again Monday and Tuesday.\n\nWhat a surprise to discover a movie about cardinals gathering in Rome to elect a new pope has the kind of mudslinging and abrupt twists and turns we\u2019re seeing in this heated race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nEdward Berger: Obviously we couldn\u2019t have predicted this because we didn\u2019t know where the word would be. But you take a movie and say, well, this could be relevant or there\u2019s a reason why we make this right now. Yes. And you always want that. I read this article about Nancy Pelosi, how she sort of pulled the strings of getting Kamala and making sure that Biden steps aside and look what good it did. My goodness. Now they at least have a chance.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was exhilarating as a result, and that wouldn\u2019t have been the case had Joe Biden not stepped aside.\n\nBerger: No, of course not. It would\u2019ve been sort of the end of it.\n\nWe saw all the new blood among the Democrats, and the diversity. We\u2019re looking at Kamala Harris\u2019 sister, this beautiful woman talking about the family\u2019s challenges and reveling in their racial mix. It reminded when Barack Obama won and there was a feeling that any kid in this country can dream of being president and it could happen.\n\nBerger: That\u2019s what you hope. We had a female chancellor in Germany for the longest time, and just imagine what that does to the world if America has a female president. It\u2019s not just America\u2019s ceiling that is raised, it\u2019s the world. We all follow America; at least the Western world looks to America. But even in, let\u2019s say, Russia, the people who they say, oh, that\u2019s weird that America is swinging that way. It just influences the world so much. If Kamala wins what that does for my children, that there is a future. I think some of these kids are kind of giving up.\n\nThey\u2019re not in the 1%\u2026\n\nBerger: Yeah, you\u2019re not in the 1% club. The environment is going down. All the governments are shit, all over the world. What do I have to aspire to? And if they see Kamala up there, they have something to aspire to. It gives the whole world a positive spin somehow.\n\nWhere were in the process of making All Quiet On The Western Front when Conclave came about? You\u2019ve made the analogy you went from the mud of the WWI trenches to the figurative mudslinging that happens in any election.\n\nBerger: Movies have a way of finding you, a way of slotting in at the right time. They come together, they take a while. I started talking to Tessa [Ross, the longtime Film4 head who is a Conclave producer] about it five years ago. The same time or maybe before All Quiet, when the producer called me and said, what do you think of making that movie? I was like, brilliant idea. I\u2019m afraid of it because I don\u2019t want to ruin the legacy of the 1930s film, but it\u2019s truly a challenge. It might be the end of us, but let\u2019s take it on. And that just went quickly. Conclave took a while. Finding the right actor was key. I worked on the script while I shot, refining the script at night and on weekends. When All Quiet was done and I was clear, we got Ralph Fiennes.\n\nYou have to find these people, they\u2019re difficult to get. They\u2019re busy. Ralph has a schedule. He\u2019s booked for years, but he wants to pick the right things. You need to find the person that responds and really wants to do it, so that you have a partnership on set. Ralph was that person. He said yes, right away. He read it within three days, called me and asked me to come to his play. Tessa and I went out for dinner with him afterwards. We got along and said, okay, let\u2019s do it. That was it. It was super simple.\n\nIt could have been, when you\u2019re making All Quiet that movies change you and you become a different person afterwards. You develop hopefully or you regress, but so you become a different person, but obviously you need to develop these things. You could finish a movie like All Quiet and find you\u2019ve fallen out of love with a movie because the experience has changed you and you go, I love the movie, but I don\u2019t really need to do Conclave anymore. The wonderful thing here is that All Quiet manifested in me the need to make it.\n\nWhy?\n\nBerger: Because it felt like I had not flexed this muscle, and I don\u2019t want to repeat myself. Let\u2019s do the opposite. This is a chamber piece, really, with a lot of dialogue. All Quiet had literally like 10 sentences of dialogue. This one is basically driven by smart dialogue. The challenge and the worry of how afraid I was of filming long dialogue and make it interesting enough to make you keep listening, that is very difficult. The dialogue needs to be great. I wanted to try that now, and work with this ensemble to try and make something different. It was the exact opposite challenge that all quiet put in front of me.\n\nRalph Fiennes in \u2018Conclave\u2019 SXSW\n\nAll Quiet won the Oscar and received much adulation. You say that the film changed you. How?\n\nBerger: The adulation doesn\u2019t change you. That doesn\u2019t matter; in a way that\u2019s noise. What changes you is the physical experience on of the making of it. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but maybe you learn certain things or I tried things that didn\u2019t work or worked. I don\u2019t need to try it again. I\u2019ve proven that to myself and next time I want to prove myself something else and be afraid again of a different task. Now, I wouldn\u2019t be afraid of a war movie, but it wouldn\u2019t be the same challenge. I would think, you know what? I might be a little bit bored doing it. It\u2019s little things where you go, you become more mature, you grow up, you want to explore something else of yourself.\n\nA friend of mine asked me, why do you flock to this movie or that movie? How do you determine? I think in the end, there\u2019s a theme in both movies that is not too dissimilar. First of all, they\u2019re both movies that are really driven by one main character, Ralph here and Felix [Kammerer] in All Quiet. And you just follow that person. It gives me the opportunity to put the camera in places that ideally get you to feel what they feel, really put you in his shoes and experience and really live it with him. I tried that with All Quiet in very different ways. They\u2019re very different type of movies. Conclave is a much more static movie than All Quiet for obvious reasons. People sit, so why move the camera?\n\nBut let\u2019s say Ralph is thinking and put the camera right here to try to keep it in his brain or straight on. It makes a huge difference how it impacts you. If he plays it a certain way, that means I need to put the camera there to make me feel what he feels. Perspective is a really important part of what draws me to Conclave because I know I\u2019m going to be with Ralph the entire time. And the other similar thing is probably the theme of liberation in the end. Ralph opens the window and he\u2019s liberated from this burden that was on his shoulders\u2026\n\nOverseeing the choosing of the Pope\u2026\n\nBerger: In the end of a quiet, Felix dies and is kind of liberated from the burden of what he had to go through.\n\nAre you a religious man?\n\nBerger: I would say I don\u2019t go to church. I\u2019ve been confirmed. My kids are confirmed because what I like about it is that it passes whatever religion it is, it passes on the history and the culture and a piece of identity that I\u2019d hate to imagine we didn\u2019t have. My wife said, just imagine we didn\u2019t have church or any religion or a temple and what comes with it, you lose a part of the culture and the identity. I think in that case it\u2019s very important, but to me that\u2019s not what drew me to Conclave. To me it was really all the power struggles that go behind the wall. It is a universal story. It could be a board room or it could be politics or it could be how to get on the field in the football team, and fight for that position in the squad. It could be the same story. And that\u2019s why I think in the end it\u2019s a universal power struggle story. That\u2019s what drew me to it. Along with Ralphs\u2019 interior journey of doubt, which I really liked.\n\nDoubt drives Conclave, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nBerger: I love the doubt theme. It resonates with a lot of people because we all have it. We all have our own journey and this one melds both my faith and my faith in movies as a changing, inspiring force. Doubt creeps in all the time. Except for the Italian Cardinal Tedesco [played by Sergio Castellitto as an arch-Conservative candidate who wants to take the Roman Catholic Church back to the stone age]. The idea is that nobody knows what the right thing is, you\u2019re going to have to go with your gut. It\u2019s no different when you make a movie and you\u2019ve got to choose what\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s your job. And you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re right.\n\nRalph Fiennes delivers a speech about doubt that changes the direction of Conclave\u2026\n\nBerger: I think the main reason why Ralph did the movie is the speech about doubt. I think when you look into his character\u2019s eyes, he\u2019s driven by doubt. And as an actor or a filmmaker, it\u2019s not an exact science. You have the best intentions to make a good movie. Is it going to be a good movie? I don\u2019t know. No one knows.\n\nWe would only have good movies if we knew. There\u2019s no recipe. You put the camera there, you hope and pray that it\u2019s going to be good. But you never know until you show it to the public. Not before. Until you are alone with the movie and that crowd. You have your producers around you, and everyone\u2019s corrupted because they\u2019ve seen it 50 times. They say, okay, this is the best it\u2019s going to be now, let\u2019s just hope that the public\u2019s going to like it. It\u2019s out of your control. And sometimes that movie can tank, even though it\u2019s maybe a good movie. And sometimes it resonates with people and takes hold, but you never know. And so I am completely driven by doubt. Every time I put the camera somewhere or I make an edit, I question myself. Is it the right one? I\u2019m completely driven by doubt and I actually take all my energy from it.\n\nThat is\u2026profound\u2026\n\nBerger: I have learned to embrace it. I\u2019ve learned to embrace doubt as a source of strength. I used to have confidence problems because of doubt, because I doubted so much. It\u2019s not like something that takes hours to decide; it\u2019s in the split second you have to make a decision. But still, your need to doubt is such an important part of making movies. And any actor who\u2019s probably doesn\u2019t know, and any director feels that all the time. Probably any journalist or a baker, an engineer, whatever you are, you\u2019re going to identify with a question of doubt. Because at some point you\u2019re going to go to your office, and think, is this really what I want?\n\nMy father was an engineer and when I was 19 and he said, you\u2019re going to have to sign up for college, I said, yeah, I\u2019m going to be an engineer. He said, really? I mean filmmaking wasn\u2019t an option. I come from a car manufacturing town. There was no filmmaker. I didn\u2019t even know you could study it. But he saw something in me. He didn\u2019t say, don\u2019t do it. He said, you can do it. But I think I always thought your interests were elsewhere. And I didn\u2019t really know that because I was like, yeah, movies is a hobby, but it\u2019s not the job. It\u2019s not a profession. So then I suddenly realized, maybe I should look into this. Maybe I should look into if I can make my passion to my profession?\n\nYou were a big movie fan?\n\nBerger: Big movie fan, but I thought, I\u2019m a movie watcher. Who doesn\u2019t love movies?\n\nWhat was the north star film that made you want to do this?\n\nBerger: Apocalypse Now. That changed me because it was the first movie that I consciously saw that I actually didn\u2019t understand and that I had to watch a couple of times. It wasn\u2019t driven by a plot because it\u2019s meandering to an upper river and looking for someone. If you\u2019re 19 or 18, you\u2019re looking for the darkness. You kind of don\u2019t quite know what that means.\n\nTalk about doubt. Francis owns that movie because nobody would take a chance on it, even after The Godfather. He had plenty of reasons to doubt himself until he brought it to Cannes as a work in progress and saw it share the Palme d\u2019Or and position itself as a classic\u2026\n\nBerger: A hundred percent. You see it in the documentary. He constantly goes, what are we doing? Anybody, any director in their right mind, would think that.\n\nWhen your father doubted your career path, did he feel like the structured sandbox he played in was too rigid, that you had a more creative mind and he sacrificed to put you in position to indulge it?\n\nBerger: My father is an engineer, he was a post-war child. He had doubts if it\u2019s the right thing that he chose. He told me, he was not going to study art because that wasn\u2019t work. But when he was 18 and in college, all he did was go to the library, read books and hear classical music. There was a dream there, but that wasn\u2019t a job. He told me that. And I suddenly realized, oh, he lived a life for pragmatic reasons. And he sort of gave me that choice that I don\u2019t have to live that life. Luckily, I was born in 1970 and not 1939. I had the opportunity to not have to have to do that.\n\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, (aka IM WESTEN NICHTS NEUES), front, from left: Albrecht Schuch, Felix Kammerer, 2022. ph: Reiner Bajo /\u00a9 Netflix /Courtesy Everett Collection Reiner Bajo/Netflix/Everett Collection\n\nWatching you temper your dreams would have meant what he sacrificed was lost?\n\nBerger: Exactly. Your job as a father or a mother I think is partly to empower your children to find their path in life, whatever that is, just to give them the freedom of choice.\n\nDid you and your dad have a moment where he saw your movie and you could see the pleasure in you realizing your path?\n\nBerger: He was always proud of all his children, he\u2019s the best father I could imagine. The most positive, inspiring beacon of positivity, and the rock. He passed away about a year and a half ago, so he didn\u2019t see the Oscar. It wouldn\u2019t have made him any prouder. He did see the movie. But he was already pretty far gone. I think he liked it, but he was not in a position to really take it in. I think he probably slept halfway through.\n\nBut he collected all newspaper articles and everything. I know he was super proud that I took a profession because he knew how hard the profession is. Because probably for 20 years, I was stuck in quite a rigid system, which is German television. You can make a movie or two, and then afterwards that path kind of closes because movie making in Germany\u2019s cinema, it\u2019s limited to certain genres. Most of movies are silly comedies. That\u2019s the only thing that somehow works, really. People think that works. And then there\u2019s very small few arthouse movies that succeed and once in a while break out. But the path there is very driven by television, and that\u2019s a product. And that took me time also to realize that I was there as a director basically to fill up airspace. And I suddenly realized, I don\u2019t want to do that, I don\u2019t want to service something that some national broadcaster decides their audience wants. It\u2019s state funded, so they need to satisfy everyone. So they decide, okay, someone from nine years old to 78 needs to like this.\n\nWhat gave you the courage to break free of that path?\n\nBerger: I studied in New York at Tisch School, and then I knocked on the door of a company that you probably know, Good Machine. I knocked on the door and said, I like your movies. I want to work. I\u2019d finished school there, and they tell you in school you\u2019re a director, you study directing in \u201894, and suddenly summer of \u201894, I realized I\u2019m a director in this school, but no one else knows I\u2019m a director, and no one else is going to pay me for that. So what do I do? I looked back at the movies that I\u2019d liked over the time, and Good Machine was a driving force back then in making these New York independent movies. So I said, where are they? I looked in the phone book and knocked on the door. Anthony Bregman opened it. He and I are going to make a movie together, and it\u2019s so nice to reunite with him after 20, 25 years. After I knocked on the door, Anthony said, come in. We chatted and he said, yeah, you can be an intern here. I was an intern for three months working for free. And then I got a job there and I worked.\n\nWhere did that take you?\n\nBerger: I learned there the ethos of filmmaking, that there has to be a reason why you make a film. What\u2019s the director\u2019s vision? We\u2019ve got to support that. At some point I was inspired, wrote a script that took place in Germany, went back in Germany, made it there. I basically left Good Machine. I made the movie there. And then another. The first was was really successful. But you always have one movie in you when you\u2019re a kid and I was 26. You have that one movie in you and you want to tell that story.\n\nAnd the second movie was kind of mediocre. It just didn\u2019t work and it took me 10 years of working in television to understand why it was only mediocre.\n\nWhy was it mediocre?\n\nBerger: I didn\u2019t have enough to say it. I was too young. I didn\u2019t know why I made the movie. And so I continued to earn my money in German television and I always made these German television movies with a heart. I put everything in there until I realized that movie by movie, I gave something of myself away. I made another compromise that took me away from the first reason why I knocked on Good Machine Store. And then I cut the ties with that and I said, I\u2019m never going to make one of those again. And I made a movie called Jack that was tiny, half a million or something, shot right around my house and got a kid that looks for his mom basically in Berlin.\n\nThat got me back to my roots. It recalibrated my brain. I said, why am I making movies? I wanted to know the reason. Every movie that I make needs to have a really good personal reason why I make it. Only then can I have the hope of transferring to the audience. It\u2019s just not employment. I was done seeking employment.\n\nAt Good Machine, you worked with Ang Lee and Todd Haynes and others. What did you learn?\n\nBerger: I worked on Sense and Sensibility. That was the main movie we did while I was there. A couple of other ones, like Walking and Talking. But the first big Hollywood movie was Sense and Sensibility. And then Ice Storm came and I had made the budget with Anthony Bregman, and there was a position there called Production Supervisor. I was making 425 bucks a week and Anthony I think was making 600 or something. And we were like six people or eight people, a tiny company.\n\nAnd he took me to lunch and said, we\u2019re making Ice Storm. I want you to be the production supervisor. Would you take that job? And I kind of swallowed, because I had done the budget with him, and there was $2,500 a week in the budget for that job. That was a 400% increase or 600% increase in salary, something like that. I was like, wow. And I said, I can\u2019t do it. And Anthony said, I was hoping you would say that.\n\nIsn\u2019t that a lovely story? He knew. Twice a year we did company reviews and evaluations of ourselves. We each wrote a page of what we want to be. And I always wrote in there, I want to be a director. And Ted Hope had always told me, what, you want to be a director? I thought you wanted to be a producer. Why? I see you work here. I said, I need to make money. And he said, if you want to be a director, you got to leave. He told me at some point, you going to have to go out there and do it.\n\nYou feared that salary would make it a comfortable living you\u2019d be hard pressed to leave?\n\nBerger: You make 2,500 a week, yeah, that\u2019s a profession. Your choice. You choose, you become a producer. It\u2019s 10 grand a month. If I stop that, no one\u2019s ever going to pay me that amount of money for starting out directing. Not even close. In 1994, that\u2019s like a massive salary. Sure it is. I just knew if I took that I would continue doing it. You just get comfortable in it and it\u2019s really hard to stop.\n\nThat\u2019s why Anthony Bregman was happy you quit?\n\nBerger: He knew I was needed to pursue what I really wanted to do. And then 20 years later we meet in New York, Anthony and I, and say, let\u2019s make a movie together.\n\nWhat did you learn from Good Machine directors that steeled you to believe you had to be one?\n\nBerger: I would say their approach, especially from Ang Lee. Talk about a director who always chose a different movie next and who wanted to be challenged. I would say with Ang, it would be about his approach to humanity, because I feel like he\u2019s a really human director, trying to understand the humanity in people, but also not someone who is sappy and goes all right, let\u2019s put the strings on this. With Todd Haynes, it would be similar. The incredible passion that he has, and he\u2019s a very precise director, and I admire that. I admire when directors are precise and not like, oh, let\u2019s try to capture this moment. But Todd Haynes, when he does a shot and writes a scene, it always has a purpose.\n\nLast one. Look up Edward Berger on the internet, and you see he\u2019s going to direct the next James Bond movie. What\u2019s the deal?\n\nBerger: That\u2019s an absolute rumor. There\u2019s no truth to it whatsoever. I would be very grateful if you put out that fire.\n\nI will, but I\u2019d like to leave a couple embers smoking. Sam Mendes made some damn good ones and he kind of reminds me of you. You\u2019d make a great 007 director\u2026\n\nBerger: He\u2019s a great filmmaker. But Barbara Broccoli is a wonderful producer. She will know what to do at the right time, and it\u2019s her family legacy. It\u2019s her job to protect this and whatever choice she\u2019s going to make is going to be the right choice for the legacy of that genre."

Quarterback Chandler Morris threw for 322 yards and four touchdowns, while running back Damashja Harris went for 142 yards and one touchdown on just 10 carries.\n\nThe Mean Green hit the road to play Texas Tech in Week 3 and they'll be looking to pull off the upset, a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" if you will."
