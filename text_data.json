            "headline": "Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?",
            "text": "Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?\n\nGetty Images\n\nThree weeks ago, just days after being formally chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was pressed on her plans for a sit-down interview. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to my team,\u201d she told reporters on the airport tarmac in Detroit. \u201cI want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\u201d On Thursday night, Ms Harris will - just barely - make good on that promise, sitting down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for her first major interview. But Ms Harris will not be there by herself. The vice-president will be joined by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for the prime-time appearance, airing at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST). Ms Harris may have answered the question of when she would conduct an in-depth, substantive discussion of her candidacy and agenda - standard procedure for all major party presidential candidates. But with Mr Walz in tow, the decision to make this a joint appearance may also fuel growing criticism that after escaping the rigours of a months-long presidential primary, she is now dodging the scrutiny that comes with a solo interview.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly weak, weak sauce, to show up with your running mate,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W Bush, on CNN, adding that Harris had a \u201ctroubling lack of confidence\" in her own political ability. Still, supporters of Ms Harris insist that given the unprecedented nature of her candidacy following President Joe Biden's sudden departure from the race, she is taking things at a smart pace. \u201cI think the cadence has been right,\u201d said Peter Giangreco, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. \u201cWin the nomination, pick your nominee, lay out your economic plan, do your convention and now do some sit-downs and amplify that.\u201d Joint interviews featuring both members of a presidential ticket are not unusual. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sat for an interview with 60 minutes after Mr Biden was selected as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Eight years later, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did the same. For Ms Harris and Mr Biden in 2020, they picked ABC\u2019s 20/20. And less than a week after Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the pair were jointly interviewed on Fox. But since Mr Biden passed the torch to her late last month, Ms Harris has limited most of her engagement with the press to scripted and highly-controlled environments. Her last formal sit-down interview was on 24 June, more than two months and a political lifetime ago. Her occasional interactions with reporters - brief answers to shouted questions on her way to and from campaign events - have done little to quell Republican claims that she is shirking any opportunity to have her record and agenda put under the microscope.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe harshest criticism comes from her Republican opponents, who have both given several interviews in the past month. \u201cShe\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Mr Trump told media earlier in August. \u201cShe won\u2019t do interviews with friendly people because she can\u2019t do better than Biden.\u201d The Democratic nominee has enjoyed a surge in momentum since entering the race. Now, after her whirlwind introduction to American voters, she needs to \"reinforce\" that energy, said Republican strategist and Trump critic Chip Felkel. \u201cShe\u2019s gotta get out there,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got to show that she can think under pressure, because that\u2019s part of what the president has to do.\u201d Since she campaigned in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Ms Harris has switched her stance on several key policy positions, backing off some of her more liberal promises. She has abandoned pledges to support Medicare for all (giving all Americans access to government-funded healthcare) and to ban fracking. And the vice-president now supports a bipartisan border bill that includes hundreds of millions of dollars on a border wall, something Ms Harris once called \"un-American\". These apparent changes could open her up to questions about being a policy flip-flopper - an unwelcome label for a candidate still trying to define herself. But by doing a joint interview, the Harris campaign may have calculated that the pressure - and the difficult questions - will at least be shared between the two of them. And it ensures both are in lockstep when it comes to explaining policy. Mr Giangreco, the Democratic strategist, predicted Ms Harris and Mr Walz will try to turn the focus onto their economic plan, an agenda to lower the cost of living and provide economic security that she first announced at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, two weeks ago. Mr Giangreco also pointed to another potential benefit of a joint interview: drawing a contrast between Mr Walz and his Republican counterpart JD Vance who he has labelled as \"weird\".\n\nKamala Harris accepts Democratic nomination 'on behalf of the people'"

            "headline": "Walz\u2019s Campaign Trail Includes Stories of Helping With Lice on Facetime, Talking About the Perils of Gutters",
            "text": "When Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate for this November\u2019s presidential election, most Americans had no idea who the Minnesota governor actually was. But as people outside of Minnesota get to know Walz, it\u2019s becoming clear through a torrent of stories shared online that he\u2019s one of the most likable politicians around. Why? He just seems like a very normal and kind person. And it\u2019s hard to find a sharper contrast between Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate JD Vance than \u201cnormal and kind.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump and Vance are clearly frustrated with being called \u201cweird,\u201d a verbal jab against modern Republicans that was first popularized by Walz. But Trump and Vance are clearly stumped about how to hit back. Because every new day online seems to deliver an anecdote or story from Walz that makes him seem both relatable and caring. And after years of Trumpism dominating the headlines with an ideology built on cruelty and humiliation, a guy like Walz is extremely refreshing.\n\nTake an old story about Walz that started going viral on Wednesday. Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, was interviewed by Politico about the fact that she would become the first Native American woman to be governor of any state. At the end of the interview, Flanagan told a story about how Walz helped her when her child got lice.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nI heard you say that your daughter was discovered to have lice the day after the 2018 election. Can you share how the newly elected Walz-Flanagan ticket handled that early crisis? My first instinct was to call Congressman Tim Walz, also governor-elect Tim Walz, to say, \u201cHelp, my child has lice, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d So that was interesting. But he was amazing. I was super freaked out. We\u2019d never dealt with it before. Siobhan was a total trooper. He said, \u201cGo to Target, and then FaceTime me from the aisle.\u201d And so I did. He had me show all the different shampoos and stuff. He was like, \u201cThis is the one that you get.\u201d And then he\u2019s like, \u201cOnce you get home, FaceTime me again.\u201d So I FaceTimed him again from the bathroom, as I\u2019m picking nits out of my child\u2019s hair. And he was amazing and coached me through the whole thing, and that is who Tim Walz is.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of story that we\u2019re hearing more and more about Walz over the years. As a teacher and coach, he touched the lives of so many people as a helpful father figure, as so many of his former students tell it. And the army of pro-Trump trolls who are trying to take him down just don\u2019t understand his appeal.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s been going viral this week involving Walz is his interview with Subway Takes on TikTok. Walz discusses how important he thinks good gutter maintenance is. And it\u2019s just the latest example of Walz talking about normal things that normal people discuss in their everyday lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to post the most vile things imaginable on social media. For example, Trump retweeted an image on Truth Social that showed Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris with the caption, \u201cFunny how blowjobs impacted both of their careers differently.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d as it were is that Clinton\u2019s husband was involved with a White House intern in the 1990s and Harris was dating Willie Brown. The right has repeatedly tried to claim, without any evidence, that she only succeeded professionally because she was dating Brown. It\u2019s a common attack from retrograde assholes. But normal people don\u2019t find it amusing. At least they don\u2019t anymore.\n\nThe late-night comedians of the 1990s tore Monica Lewinsky to shreds with those kinds of jokes. But here in the 2020s, the U.S. public sees Lewinsky much differently than she was depicted in late 20th-century news and comedy programs. And that\u2019s probably why these assholes don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re the weird ones. Guys like Trump and Vance are trying to bring America back to the 1990s, back when Trump thought he was hot shit and Vance was a kid. Both men are trying to turn back the clock, from their stupid jokes to their ideas about reproductive health. But there\u2019s a reason that Harris has embraced a slogan that really seems to resonate with most people: We\u2019re not going back."

            "headline": "X Straightens Up Grok After Election Misinformation Warnings",
            "text": "Few mainstream social media sites have become more inundated with misinformation since the 2020 presidential election than X. Elon Musk bought the platform formerly known as Twitter in late 2022 and quickly instituted policies that allowed the worst elements of society to thrive. But X reportedly fixed at least one problem recently identified by several state attorneys general with the AI chatbot Grok. And it may be a small fix, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nWhat was the problem with X\u2019s Grok? Apparently, when you asked it questions about the 2024 election, the AI would repeatedly get things wrong about election laws. When President Joe Biden stepped aside on July 21 to allow Kamala Harris to run, Grok users were fed all kinds of information that simply wasn\u2019t true when asked about how things would change in the race.\n\nThe secretaries of state for Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Washington all wrote a joint letter to Elon Musk and X about the problems on August 5. The letter laid out some of the most concerning problems, like the answers Grok would give about whether Harris still had time to get on the ballot to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nFrom the letter, which was also published online:\n\nWithin hours of President Joe Biden stepping away from his presidential candidacy on July 21, 2024, false information on ballot deadlines produced by Grok was shared on multiple social media platforms. The post from Grok said, \u201cThe ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election. Some of these states include: 1. Alabama 2. Indiana 3. Michigan 4. Minnesota 5. New Mexico 6. Ohio 7. Pennsylvania 8. Texas 9. Washington.\u201d This is false. In all nine states the opposite is true: The ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nWhile the letter notes Grok is only available to paying subscribers on X, and includes a disclaimer about the fact that Grok can get things wrong, the secretaries of state noted how the false information about ballot deadlines had \u201cbeen captured and shared repeatedly in multiple posts\u2014reaching millions of people.\u201d And that\u2019s the bigger problem. Grok is a relatively niche service for people who are dumb enough to give Elon Musk money. However, the information from Grok can spread far and wide if people share screenshots on X and other social media sites. Especially if that information confirms existing biases or preconceived notions for confused individuals, like the idea that Harris is somehow ineligible to become president.\n\nBut Grok has reportedly been fixed, at least when it comes to information about ballot deadlines. The secretaries of state released a new letter on Monday praising X for doing something about it. Grok now directs users to Vote.gov, which has accurate information about voting rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate X\u2019s action to improve their platform and hope they continue to make improvements that will ensure their users have access to accurate information from trusted sources in this critical election year,\u201d the new letter reads. \u201cElections are a team effort, and we need and welcome any partners who are committed to ensuring free, fair, secure, and accurate elections.\u201d\n\nAs the secretaries of state note, the finer points of election rules can vary by state, which can make it difficult to keep things straight. But Vote.gov has the information that people need. And as long as Grok directs people there, rather than making shit up, things should be alright.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., all elections are run by local officials, who are supported and overseen by a state agency,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cElection rules and procedures can vary widely from state to state, and voters should seek out information from their local election officials about who can vote when they can vote, and how they can vote in their area. Websites like Vote.gov and CanIVote.org are also trustworthy resources that can connect voters with their local election officials.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to register to vote. Depending on where you live, the deadline could be coming soon."

            "headline": "Harris' first sit-down interview as nominee airs Thursday with pressure building",
            "text": "Harris explains policy shifts and her 'day one' in 1st sit-down interview as nominee\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nVice President Harris outlined her day-one agenda to support middle-class families if she were to win the election this fall in her first sit-down interview since becoming the Democratic nominee for president. She addressed plans to make housing more affordable and to expand the child tax credit, and she acknowledged that despite economic growth since the pandemic, prices are still too high for many Americans.\n\n\u201cPrices, in particular for groceries, are still too high. The American people know it. I know it,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris, who was joined by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sat down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for the interview during a campaign swing in Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe wide-ranging conversation was a high-stakes moment for Harris, after she had faced mounting pressure to do an interview with a major news outlet to share her own policies and take questions on her prior positions, some of which have changed since she became President Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020.\n\nBash pressed Harris on her shifted stances on both banning fracking and decriminalizing border crossings. Harris in 2019, when she first ran for president, said she was against a fracking ban and was for decriminalizing border crossings. Her stance on both policies has changed since then \u2014 but Harris insisted that her values have not.\n\n\u201cI think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is, my values have not changed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\u201d\n\nHarris said she would keep her word that she would not ban fracking \u2014 an issue that is front and center in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd on decriminalizing border crossings, Harris said, \u201cI believe there should be consequences. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHarris also addressed foreign policy, namely the continued U.S. aid to Israel in its war in Gaza. When asked if Harris would withhold some shipments of weapons to Israel, Harris did not directly answer the question, and instead reiterated her call for a ceasefire deal and getting the hostages home.\n\n\u201cI remain committed since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self determination and dignity,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the interview, Harris also committed to having a Republican in her presidential cabinet \u2013 and said it would be to the benefit of the American public to have someone who has different views and different experiences working with her.\n\nThe interview was wide-ranging, covering Walz\u2019s record and past controversies, President Biden\u2019s legacy and ability to serve, as well as the phone call between Biden and Harris the day he decided to step down from the race.\n\nQuestions over Walz\u2019 comments on weapons of war, and his path to having children\n\nWalz had only a few questions directed at him during the interview. He was asked about previous comments he made in 2018 about carrying a weapon into war \u2013 which Walz never did. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war and my wife, the English teacher, telling me my grammar is not always correct,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cMy record speaks for itself\u2026 I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWalz and his wife used a method known as IUI to have children \u2013 but has said they used IVF in the past. On that issue, Walz said he thinks most Americans \u201cget it if you\u2019ve been through that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child,\u201d he said.\n\nNew details on the call between Biden and Harris when Biden stepped down\n\nHarris revealed that she was spending time with her family, cooking breakfast and about to sit down for a puzzle when Biden called her last month to let her know he was ending his campaign for reelection.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 \u201d Harris said.\n\nShe noted that Biden made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that he was going to support Harris\u2019 campaign for president. She called the president \u201cselfless\u201d and said he puts the American people first.\n\nRepublicans like Trump had been accusing Harris of trying to dodge tough questions\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a month since Biden dropped out of the race, and in the absence of a 1-on-1 Harris interview or press conference, Republicans have accused the vice president of trying to dodge the press to avoid tough questions. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done an interview,\u201d former President Donald Trump said during a news conference earlier this month at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent, and she can\u2019t do an interview.\u201d\n\nPrior to becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris had taken plenty of questions from reporters as the sitting vice president. Her team says she\u2019s done 80 interviews this year \u2014 in traditional, network media as well as on podcasts and social media.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut in these previous conversations she was generally selling Biden\u2019s agenda. Like most vice presidents, she was a messenger and a deputy. Now, she\u2019s running for the top job, and this CNN interview may be one of the first times she\u2019s pressed to spell out her own policies and answer questions about how, if at all, she would govern differently than Biden.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d have to answer more of these questions,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible to run for president and not answer them.\u201d\n\nHarris will, undoubtedly, face additional scrutiny about her record and positions when she faces off against Trump in the debate expected next month.\n\nTrump, for his part, posted on his platform Truth Social as the interview with Harris aired on CNN.\n\n\u201cI look so forward to Debating Comrade Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is. Harris has changed every one of her long held positions, on everything,\u201d he said. He also posted: \u201cBORING!!!\u201d\n\n"

Now they finally have a presidential ticket that explicitly echoes their agenda.\n\nThese activists and their diverse coalition \u2014 who call themselves YIMBYs, for \"yes in my backyard\" \u2014 have sprung into action to support Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. On Wednesday night, they held a two-hour virtual \"YIMBYs for Harris\" fundraiser featuring dozens of local, state, and federal lawmakers who believe in building lots more housing.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nPro-housing advocates say Harris' proposal to build 3 million homes in her first term, in part through cutting government regulations restricting construction, feels like a big shift toward addressing the country's housing shortage. It doesn't hurt that Harris selected as her running mate a governor who has championed pro-housing policies in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris and other top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, highlighted the housing shortage in their speeches at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 sending YIMBYs into a tizzy. Democrats in Washington have long supported demand-side housing policies, including subsidies for homebuyers and low-income renters. But recent national messaging on the issue has focused much more squarely on solving the supply shortage, which is particularly severe in blue states and cities where onerous permitting requirements, environmental reviews, and opposition from so-called NIMBYs \u2014 \"not in my backyard\" \u2014 have hamstrung efforts to build more homes.\n\n\"There's always been Democrats saying we should fund more affordable housing,\" Armand Domalewski, a San Francisco-based data analyst who helped organize YIMBYs for Harris, told Business Insider. What's new on the national stage, he added, is \"the perspective that part of the issue is local and state governments obstructing housing.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nShortly after Domalewski set up a WhatsApp group for pro-housing voters about three weeks ago, \"it just exploded,\" he said. About 300 people are in the chat, he said, and the group estimated that about 6,000 people attended Wednesday's virtual fundraiser, which raised more than $100,000.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, a headliner at the fundraiser, argued that his party was experiencing a \"generational shift\" in its approach to housing. He's called Harris \"the first presidential nominee in at least a generation that cares about housing.\" Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado similarly described Harris at the event as \"the most pro-housing president in the history of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want somebody that is actually going to work to solve the problem of the housing shortage,\" Schatz said. \"And the simplest way to solve the problem of the housing shortage is to make it permissible for people to build as much housing as they can, especially for working people.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, a 46-year-old California Democrat who's been one of the loudest urbanist voices in Congress, noted in his remarks during the fundraiser that he was organizing the first YIMBY congressional caucus.\n\nThe fact that housing policy is high on the list of national Democratic priorities indicates how severe the affordability crisis has gotten. Harris, Obama, and other top Democrats aren't suddenly YIMBY converts \u2014 they're talking about the housing shortage because Americans are more worried about it. In a recent survey , 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans said they thought a lack of affordable housing was a significant problem.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't said much on the campaign trail about housing, though he and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have argued they could solve the supply shortage by deporting millions of immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral speakers at the YIMBY fundraiser argued that, despite being the anti-regulation party, Republicans had embraced red tape that limits what can be built and where. In the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 agenda, Ben Carson, who was Trump's secretary of housing and urban development, wrote that Republicans should \"oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning.\""

However, if nothing is done to address the dearth of housing supply, then jump-starting nationwide demand will simply exacerbate the housing crisis as people scramble to snatch up already-scarce homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The demand side doesn't help over the long run,\" Olsen said. \"If you want sweeping policy that's very generalizable, have it be on the supply side.\"\n\nOlsen also doesn't think the first-time homebuyer criteria is the most useful way to increase housing access for those who need it the most.\n\n\"I could be a first-time buyer, but I have a great network, a bank of mom and dad, that could help me move forward. And now you've given me an extra boost,\" Olsen said.\n\nFocusing on boosting first-generation homeownership could help combat that issue, which Harris' plan addresses, although the exact details have yet to be revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Olsen believes a federal down payment assistance plan is simply a band-aid fix for structural issues in the US housing market \u2014 namely, lack of supply.\n\n\"It can end up just getting us revved up without solving the long-run problem,\" Olsen said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHere's what will actually help home affordability\n\nThat's not to say that all down payment assistance plans are doomed to fail. When done right, these programs can be quite beneficial, Olsen said.\n\nThe key comes down to whether such a plan is implemented at the federal or local level. According to Olsen, local homebuying incentives that increase demand are more targeted than a blanket federal policy like the one Harris proposed, making them more effective in increasing homeowning accessibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, a state with a low population might have a lot of underused infrastructure. In this case, incentives to boost housing demand at the state level could help redistribute people to areas with excess home supply.\n\n\"If you want to solve things with the demand side of the coin for the long run, it's gonna be more about 'How do I get the people to want to go where the supply is?'\" Olsen said.\n\nBut again, Olsen believes that policies increasing the housing supply are the most effective way to alleviate the current housing crisis.\n\nHarris has actually put out proposals addressing the supply side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion aims to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. The fund will provide $20 billion in funding to lower land use restrictions, modernize zoning policies, stimulate development, and encourage innovative housing solutions. This plan emphasizes building multifamily rental units and starter homes for middle-class families, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of units.\n\nAnd the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit provides tax credits to developers who build affordable housing units, which helps low-income tenants in finding affordable and available units. This policy encourages mixed-income developments such as multifamily housing rented to tenants from a variety of income backgrounds."

            "text": "Harris is on a 2-day Georgia bus tour. It\u2019s the latest sign the state is in play\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are back on their campaign bus. The pair are together on the campaign trail for the first time since last week\u2019s Democratic convention. This time, they\u2019re on a two-day bus tour of Georgia.\n\nTheir trip is taking them into areas of the state that don\u2019t always get attention from Democratic politicians. It will also be the site of Harris\u2019 first major network interview since becoming her party\u2019s nominee for president, on Thursday.\n\nThe attention this week is just the latest sign that Georgia, a state President Biden narrowly won in 2020, is once again in play this election year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThis area is a priority for the campaign: we have nearly 50 full-time staff across 7 offices in South Georgia,\u201d said Porsha White, the Georgia state director for the Harris campaign, ahead of the trip. \u201cThis will be the first time a general election presidential candidate will have campaigned in Savannah since the 1990s.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpon arrival in Savannah, Harris and Walz greeted students from Savannah State University, the oldest public HBCU in Georgia, before boarding their campaign bus.\n\nTheir first stop on Wednesday was to a marching band rehearsal at Liberty County High School, which, according to U.S. News and World Report, has about 1,000 students, a majority of them \u201ceconomically disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nThe room erupted when Harris and Walz walked in, and the band played the school fight song with football players and cheerleaders in the back of the room. Leaning into his experience as a former coach, Walz gave a quick speech about teamwork. Harris told the crowd they were all leaders in their own way.\n\nNext stop: Sandfly Bar-B-Q in Savannah, a restaurant decorated with license plates from various states. Harris and Walz were greeted by the restaurant's owner, employees and local patrons. Walz sought out a group of teachers and praised their \u201cnoble\u201d work. He talked about the importance of optimism and insisted, \u201cOur politics can be hopeful.\u201d Outside, a man held a Trump flag.\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Harris stopped by Dottie\u2019s Market in Savannah, where she told the owner she plans to announce a tax credit to boost small business creation. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to be rolling out next week is basically a tax credit for startups, small business startups,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLater was a rally at the city's Enmarket Arena, where she outlined her vision to \"fight for America\u2019s future\" that included Medicaid expansion, focusing on middle- and working-class families and expanding reproductive rights.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader strategy to reach voters in traditionally Republican areas in swing states\n\nSavannah \u2014 like most major cities \u2014 votes strongly Democratic. But it is swimming in a sea of red \u2014 and that\u2019s where Harris and Walz are campaigning.\n\n\u201cThe whole point is to overperform,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie. \u201cAnd so you want to overperform not just among your base, but you also want to overperform in places where you have historically been weak.\u201d\n\nThat means campaigning far from the Democratic strongholds of Atlanta, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C., to narrow the margins in parts of those competitive swing states that have typically voted Republican. In other words, losing by less.\n\nIn Georgia, where reliably Republican voters still outnumber reliably Democratic ones, that\u2019s really the only way to have a chance at winning.\n\n\u201cDemocrats also want to perform better than they historically have in other parts of the state, so you want to be able to post stronger margins \u2014 even if they are losing margins \u2014 in other parts of the state,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nBoth campaigns put money and time into Georgia\n\nIn presidential races, there are two big indicators of how campaigns are feeling about their chances in a state: time and money. Since Harris got into the race, Donald Trump and his allies have spent nearly $33 million on ads in the state, mostly trying to define Harris with pretty negative messaging. Meanwhile Harris and her allies have spent nearly $23 million, mostly on more positive ads introducing her to voters. That\u2019s according to an NPR analysis of data from the tracking firm Ad Impact. People watching TV in Georgia are seeing a ton of campaign ads already.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToday, the Harris campaign launched its first \u201ccontrast\u201d ad, hitting Trump and tying him to the unpopular conservative roadmap known as Project 2025. That will be on heavy rotation in Georgia and other swing states.\n\ntoggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Harris campaign has invested in 24 offices around Georgia, including in more traditionally Republican areas. Since Harris started running for president, White says they\u2019ve brought in 35,000 new volunteers.\n\nAs for time: Trump held a rally in Georgia earlier this month \u2014 though he spent part of his speech bashing the state\u2019s Republican governor. (Trump has since made a public show of saying they\u2019ve worked things out.) This week\u2019s bus tour is Harris\u2019 second trip to the state in less than a month.\n\nPolling averages show the race remains close \u2014 and it\u2019s much closer with Harris at the top of the ticket than when Biden was the presumptive nominee . Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes. But the state\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators are proof that a Democrat can win if they run a near-perfect campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign will also be turning up the heat in the state this week in an effort to win it back. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene plans to head to a volunteer phone bank in Rome, Ga. In a release she cites \u201cdozens of paid staff, thousands of volunteers, and field offices in every part of the state, from Atlanta to Savannah to the Valdosta. Team Trump will not leave a stone unturned this fall.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, Georgia is a must-win state. For Harris, it would open up additional paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win.\n\n\n\nHarris and Walz will take a pitstop in Georgia to do an interview\n\nAs Harris and Walz meet voters in person, they are also set to sit down for their first television interview together. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash interviewed them at Kim\u2019s Cafe, a Black-owned restaurant in Savannah, this afternoon. It will air at 9 p.m. EST on CNN.\n\nFor the entirety of Harris\u2019 nascent candidacy, she has been in a position to control the message, and she has largely delivered prepared remarks from teleprompter. The interview is, of course, a different format, where she is likely to be pressed on areas where her position has changed since the Democratic primary in 2020, when she supported some version of Medicare for All, opposed fracking and didn\u2019t have as hard of a line on immigration and border security as she does now.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe won\u2019t be alone. Walz will also be part of the interview, which means there likely will be some questions about their relationship and how they would work together \u2014 questions that by their nature are not as perilous as trying to explain policy shifts.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been publicly badgering Harris to do an interview, in part because they are looking for something to pounce on where they can actually get some traction. They have been trying unsuccessfully for five weeks to end her campaign honeymoon and make some attacks stick, and this interview is the best chance they\u2019ve had in a while.\n\nAlready, Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance is criticizing Harris and Walz for doing a joint appearance rather than having Harris sit for a grilling alone. But it\u2019s not clear how much voters really care about these intricacies."

He is accused of running the platform where these crimes took place, not committing the crimes himself. Durov co-founded the popular messaging app in 2013.

Telegram users typically find the service attractive due to its limited oversight of what they can say. This has made the app a favorite tool for far-right extremist groups, terrorist organizations and criminal gangs. Investigators say Durov failed to cooperate with them, which would have helped them shut down the illegal operations. He is now under judicial supervision and banned from leaving French territory.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump shared a TikTok video yesterday including footage that likely violates federal law against using military cemeteries for campaigning purposes. The video was posted after NPR reported Trump campaign staffers had a physical altercation Monday with an Arlington National Cemetery staffer who was trying to enforce restrictions during a remembrance ceremony.

She found in her reporting that these efforts have swept up U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote. Maintaining voter rolls is a critical election safeguard and federal law says it can\u2019t happen within 90 days of an election. Advocacy groups have asked Tennessee and Alabama to halt sending letters to people they suspect are noncitizens, saying it's violating federal law. Tennessee later said people who received letters wouldn\u2019t be purged from voter rolls.

            "headline": "What's Your 'Sleep Language'? Here Are the 5 Different Types and How to Speak Yours",
            "text": "There's a reason why experts suggest adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. From preventing forgetfulness to impacting your life expectancy, there's a laundry list of health reasons you should be getting quality sleep each night. However, reaching that goal isn't always easy. It can be difficult to find the correct code of hacks to unlock your sleep potential and get the rest your body needs.\n\nShelby Harris, a clinical sleep psychologist, is aiming to crack that code through partnership with the popular meditation app and mental health brand Calm. Harris and Calm have published a working understanding of the \"five sleep languages\" -- a sectioning off of a few different sleeping patterns (or lack thereof) to give people more actionable steps to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNET\n\nHarris said she came up with the five different sleep languages after considering differences among her patients over her 20 years of experience and noticing that there are a handful of categories they tend to fall into.\n\n\"We can give people a whole list of sleep hygiene targets to follow or when they should see a sleep doctor, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming for people,\" Harris said. The goal of the different sleep languages is to meet people where they are in their sleep health journey.\n\n\"It helps to guide where they want to go with what they can start with.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about your sleep language and how to use this knowledge to improve your sleep. For more advice on how to improve your sleep quality, here are eight ways to promote sleepiness and how your diet is linked to your sleep.\n\nThe 5 sleep languages and tips for speaking yours\n\nHarris has landed on five sleep languages, but it's important to note you can switch between them throughout your lifetime, she says.\n\nBelow are the five sleep languages, as described in Calm's blog.\n\n1. The 'gifted' sleeper\n\nIf you're a gifted sleeper, you probably appear to the people around you just as that -- gifted, in the name of sleep. Maybe you can fall asleep anywhere, no matter the noise or background light, or you have no problem napping. Any way you slice it, the gifted sleeper typically doesn't have a problem falling or staying asleep.\n\nTips for the gifted sleeper\n\nWhile this may seem like the \"best\" sleep language category to belong to, objectively speaking, gifted sleepers might want to see a sleep doctor if they're sleeping too much, as it could be a sign of a health condition. It can be especially important to follow up with a doctor if you're sleeping a lot but still not feeling well rested.\n\nBut if there isn't something else at play, consider whether you're actually playing catchup on sleep deprivation and whether you can benefit from a stricter sleep routine, according to the Calm post.\n\n2. The 'words of worry' sleeper\n\nIf you're a \"words of worry\" sleeper, you might know who you are. Your brain is loud at night, clouded with the \"what ifs\" of the day, and what you have to get done tomorrow. Whether it be the past or the present, a words of worry sleeper is focused on another time other than the present and the physical focus at hand: sleep.\n\nTips those who worry about sleep\n\n\"I have a lot of patients that come to me where their brains just won't turn off,\" Harris said. If you can relate to this, be clear on your sleep boundaries and limit things like screen time, or cross-contaminating nonsleep activities in the bedroom, like work. You may also benefit from adding a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation to your day, or trying this CNET to-do list hack for better sleep.\n\nWorking or scrolling in bed is a no-go when you're looking to improve your sleep. Skaman306/Getty Images\n\n3. The 'routine perfectionist' sleeper\n\nIf you're a perfectionist sleeper, you may have followed our sleep advice a little too hard to the detriment of your happiness, and sometimes, your sleep. You may be a perfectionist sleeper if you find yourself missing out on fun events, or other special occasions that may be important to you, over fear of having one night of poor sleep. Or when something or someone throws your sleep off, you're irritated.\n\n\"Those people I often see because they used to be a words of worry person or have some type of sleep issue, that then they became hyperobsessed with it,\" Harris said.\n\nTips for those a little too perfect about sleep\n\nAs laid out in the Calm blog, perfectionist sleepers will benefit from a little more flexibility and switching things up -- things that will create \"less attachment\" to your sleep routine. To get started, move around the order of your sleep routine slightly (maybe you'll brush your teeth before you put on your pajamas today, for example).\n\nLike the other sleep languages, a perfect sleeper may benefit from practicing mindfulness, which can improve your ability to relate to anxiety-inducing thoughts in a way that's not so stressful.\n\n4. The 'too hot to handle' sleeper\n\nIt's in the name, but if you're too hot to handle, you're too hot to sleep. Menopause, perimenopause, other health conditions or even a mismatched bed partner with a different internal temperature can make you too hot to handle.\n\nTips for sleep hotties\n\nIf you're waking up drenched in sweat, or you're finding yourself frequently uncomfortable at night, check in with your doctor to see what underlying health condition may be at play. Medication side effects or hormonal changes can also influence how warm you feel at night, as the Calm post points out.\n\nBut if your bed partner is the culprit, follow this CNET tip and consider getting two separate blankets or comforters, which can also cut down on blanket tug-of-war.\n\n5. The 'light as a feather' sleeper\n\nLight sleepers wake up easily from noise, light or even a strong smell. If you're light as a feather, you might wake up in the morning after a solid seven or eight hours on the pillow still feeling unrested or sleepy.\n\nTips for those light as a feather\n\nIf you're restless and not getting the quality of sleep you want, consider sharpening your bedtime routine and adding a bit more structure -- including setting those bed boundaries, like not scrolling through social media or eating in your bed. (Loose crumbs itching your bare legs may be the last thing a light sleeper needs.)\n\nCalm and Harris also suggest reaching out to a sleep professional if you're concerned about the quality of your rest, screening for sleep conditions such as sleep talking, grinding teeth and sleep apnea.\n\nD3sign/Getty Images\n\nThe link between mental health and sleep\n\nHarris says she decided to partner with Calm in response to the current mental health crisis. The pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of anxiety, eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Mental health can be improved or harmed by someone's sleep patterns.\n\nSleep deprivation, in particular, can affect your ability to stay in control of your emotions or come up with solutions to seemingly not-so-complicated problems that can feel like the end of the world when you're sleep-deprived. (I asked Harris if there was any truth to my feeling like I regress to a child's ability to handle emotions when I'm sleep-deprived, and she explained that sleep deprivation disrupts the part of our mind responsible for reasoning and judgment, and our ability to toggle between states, or our cognitive flexibility.)\n\n\"With sleep deprivation in general, we find higher rates of anxiety, higher rates of depression, higher rates of stress,\" she said. \"And we find their stress tolerance and ability to cope with daily stressors becomes much more difficult.\"\n\nThe critical component is REM sleep, which you may be deficient in if you're regularly lacking sleep. This could lead to problems in your relationship or at work.\n\n\"REM sleep is really important for emotion processing, memories,\" Harris said. \"If you're waking up early or you're not getting enough REM sleep routinely, you're gonna have trouble with irritability, depression, anxiety, all that jazz.\"\n\nAnother bottom line on good sleep\n\nDespite the number of times we preach the health benefits of sleep, there's a thread in society that may be pushing back against the idea that healthy sleep trumps all. But according to Harris, \"No pun intended, you're living in a dream world a little bit,\" if you're trying to check off everything else on the wellness list before you start prioritizing sleep. Centering sleep will help you stabilize and prioritize all the other tasks you have during the day.\n\n\"We have to stop the hamster wheel somewhere, and if you stop it by prioritizing sleep, it makes the daytime run smoother.\""

            "headline": "How Beau Biden Set the Stage For Kamala Harris\u2019 Stunning Political Rise",
            "text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere were days the pair talked to each other more than they spoke to the people who slept under their roofs.\n\nKamala Harris was the state attorney general of California and Beau Biden was in the same role over in Delaware, where so many of the banks she was fighting were based. At the height of the clean-up from the 2008 financial crisis, more than a million California households caught up in the foreclosure wave were struggling to stay in their homes. For Harris to help any of them, she needed backup from Biden, who had oversight over Wilmington, Del., the banking industry's stealth capital. That partnership helped Harris emerge as one of the only political leaders in the country seen as holding bankers accountable for predatory practices.\n\nBeau Biden had Harris\u2019 flank until the end of his too-brief life, which ended in 2015 at age 46. Five years later, the man Beau called \u201cPop\u201d tapped Harris as his running mate, creating one of the most unlikely partnerships in Democratic politics. And when President Joe Biden decided to forgo the nomination this year and clear the way for Harris, it was the dividend on an accidental alliance forged in the early 2010s when two rising stars of the Democratic Party aligned and, to the point it\u2019s become canon, actually became sincere friends.\n\nBeau Biden was atop Harris\u2019 mind last month when she accepted the elder Biden\u2019s endorsement to be the next President. \u201cI first came to know President Biden through his son, Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe\u2019s leadership as President.\u201d\n\nTrite? Sure. But it has the benefit of also happening to be true.\n\nUp until Beau Biden\u2019s death, Joe Biden long believed his son had the potential to surpass his own impressive political career. So when the elder Biden tapped Harris four years ago this month, it was in no small measure based on her true friendship with the younger Biden. As I wrote at the time, one question hung over his deliberation more than any other: What Would Beau Do? That\u2019s how Biden got to yes on Harris, despite his primary rivalry with her and a skepticism that she actually believed in the vision for America she was pitching in her own White House run.\n\n\u201cI first met Kamala through my son Beau,\u201d Biden said during his roll-out of Harris. \u201cHe had enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one\u2019s opinion I valued more than Beau\u2019s, and I\u2019m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Joe Biden stood aside to give Harris her best shot to date at winning the top job in global politics. In ways great and small, it was a moment set up by Beau Biden, who in the aughts connected with his colleague in California and decided they\u2019d be great partners\u2014and, perhaps, the future of their shared Democratic Party. One succumbed to brain cancer and the other is currently leading Donald Trump in most national polls. What started as a check on banking overreach now stands to be the driving force behind Democratic politics. And, from the outside, it looks like a not entirely bad level of match-making.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter."

            "text": "After major police endorsement, Rep. Gallego faces backlash from progressive groups\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nAfter drawing praise for an endorsement by Arizona police, Rep. Ruben Gallego has now drawn anger and disappointment from some Arizona progressives for discouraging the Department of Justice from imposing federal oversight on the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department \u2014 sent one day after the Arizona Police Association announced it\u2019s backing Gallego in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race \u2014 the congressman said federal investigators \u201cmissed the mark\u201d in their examination of Phoenix police.\n\nThat nearly three-year investigation concluded in June that Phoenix police have engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of using excessive force, acting with bias and violating constitutional and civil rights.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn his letter, Gallego described those violations \u2013 \u201ca mere 120 or so unspecified incidents across eight years,\u201d he wrote \u2013 as isolated, not pervasive. And he argued against the need for federal oversight for the city\u2019s police department, a position aligned with some of the Phoenix City Council members, who\u2019ve resisted calls from community groups for the DOJ\u2019s further involvement.\n\nPhoenix police and city officials \u201calready welcome reforms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOversight, Gallego wrote, would be best left to local government.\n\n\n\nPolice back \u2018a freaking loser\u2019\n\nWhen it was announced Monday, the Arizona Police Association\u2019s endorsement was a coup for Gallego\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe APA describes itself as an umbrella organization \u2013 \u201can association of associations\u201d \u2013 that brings together various law enforcement entities from across the state. In doing so, they represent thousands of law enforcement officers in Arizona.\n\nThe week prior, APA President Justin Harris had joined Donald Trump onstage at a rally in Glendale to announce the organization\u2019s support of the former president \u2013 someone who Harris said could get our country \u201cback on track and make America great again.\u201d\n\nAlso onstage that day, Trump described Gallego as \u201ca freaking loser.\u201d\n\nDays later, the APA endorsed that \u201closer\u201d \u2013 \u201ca Marine combat veteran\u201d who \u201cunderstands the complexities of modern policing in American society today,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe APA does not take our endorsements lightly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe recognize the importance of having a U.S. senator that can bring people together to improve society for all. We believe Congressman Gallego will be that U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an endorsement that should come in handy as Gallego defends his record from the Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee, Kari Lake, who the APA endorsed for governor in 2022.\n\nWhile a Lake spokesperson accused Gallego of supporting the defunding of police, Harris praised the congressman for backing federal legislation to boost hiring and retention of police officers.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gallego has continually fought for robust, increased funding for America\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Just lost my vote\u2019\n\nGallego\u2019s letter stunned Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona.\n\n\u201cTo act as if (the DOJ\u2019s report) is in some way not accurately reflective of \u2013 detailing the significant problems with the Phoenix Police Department, is simply not true,\u201d Keenan said.\n\nThe timing of the letter, immediately following the endorsement of the state\u2019s largest independent law enforcement organization, made it worse, he said.\n\n\u201cIt seems very transactional,\u201d Keenan said.\n\n\u201cA lot of city officials and Rep. Gallego, they speak about public safety,\u201d he added. \u201cBut true public safety cannot ignore constitutional rights. It cannot ignore the violence perpetrated by the Phoenix Police Department on members of our community. And to issue statements like this is, frankly, dangerous, because it will embolden the police not to reform themselves.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Poder In Action, a community group that routinely lodges complaints about police treatment of Black, brown and Indigenous communities, called the claims in the letter \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to the communities Gallego represents in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is really just ridiculous to, after all of this evidence, to say that this department can change itself,\u201d executive director Viri Hernandez said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHernandez also said she wasn\u2019t shocked Gallego\u2019s letter came on the heels of the APA endorsement.\n\n\u201cOur community sees the way that police unions, when they support candidates, most of the time \u2014 every example we\u2019ve seen \u2014 also leads to those candidates pushing back against accountability, transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether the police endorsement was tied to the DOJ letter, a spokesperson for the Gallego campaign says there was \u201cno agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuben Gallego has a record of fighting for Arizona\u2019s law enforcement in Congress and is proud to have the support of the Arizona Police Association,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nPoder In Action isn\u2019t in the business of endorsing candidates. As a 501(c)3, they\u2019re barred from intervening in political campaigns. \u201cOur focus is to expose the discrepancies, the lies from any party \u2013 Democrats or Republicans,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell folks who to vote for, who to not vote for,\u201d she added.\n\nNeither does the ACLU of Arizona. But personally, Keenan didn\u2019t mince words when he first responded to the letter on X."

Read preview\n\nDonald Trump is worried about the use of AI in the forthcoming election.\n\nThe former president has called AI \"very dangerous\" and accused his opponent, Kamala Harris, of using it to exaggerate the size of one of her rally crowds.\n\n\"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?\" Trump said in a lengthy, capital-letter-strewn Truth Social post earlier this month.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\n\"There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d it,\" he wrote, adding: \"She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Trump's claim, the crowds shown in the image were genuine. An official from the Harris-Walz campaign told Business Insider that the photo had been taken by campaign staff and \"not modified by AI in any way.\"\n\nIn the weeks following his post accusing Harris of using AI, the former president went on to post several apparently AI-generated memes on Truth Social and X. The images depicted real-life figures, including Kamala Harris and Elon Musk.\n\nHe also reshared on Truth Social a set of dubious images of Taylor Swift and her fans with pro-Trump messaging. While two of the images appeared to show a genuine Trump supporter, others, including several images of women in \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirts, had telltale signs of being AI-generated.\n\nTrump later denied making the images himself and reflected on the use of AI more generally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're seeing it all the time,\" Trump said of AI-created content. \"It's a little bit dangerous out there.\"\n\nThe Swift photos had already attracted criticism online and made headlines. While that may have been exactly what Trump wanted, the former president's willingness to post what looks like AI-generated content without clear labels risks confusing some voters.\n\nViral misinformation\n\nExperts have long feared the widespread use of AI has the potential to affect elections around the world.\n\nDeepfakes, AI-generated text, and hyper-targeted ads can blur the line between fact and fiction, making it harder for voters to discern what is credible information. Bad actors can also use AI tools to purposely spread realistic disinformation on social media at an unprecedented scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublic literacy around AI-generated content also varies. While some people can easily identify fake content, others can be convinced by fake images or text.\n\n\"This content is also going viral before anybody has really fact-checked it,\" Eric Wengrowski, the CEO of Steg.AI, told Business Insider. \"It's also coming from a former president.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWengrowski said while it wasn't unethical for politicians to share AI-generated content for humorous or satirical reasons, public figures should ensure the content is labeled as AI.\n\n\"I do think it's unethical for politicians to be sharing AI-generated content if it is not clearly labeled with the appropriate watermark,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegal consequences\n\nThe legality of posting AI-generated images that use the likeness of public figures is also murky.\n\n\"It really depends on how the content is being presented,\" Brent Mittelstadt, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, said. \"If it's clearly being presented as a joke or as satire, then you're in a much stronger legal position.\"\n\n\"If something to a reasonable person would obviously be satire, then at a minimum, with things like copyright or usage of somebody's likeness, you can basically get around legal obligations in that way,\" he said.\n\nIn the case of the Swift-related content, Mittelstadt said it wasn't clear if the images were being presented as memes or satire. \"It's not to a reasonable person obviously fake, just from the content itself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for Trump did not respond to a request for comment from BI."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris Redefines \u2018American Exceptionalism\u2019 for a New Generation of Voters",
            "text": "Stengel is the former Editor of TIME, an MSNBC analyst and the author of Information Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation .\n\nIn the final moments of her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris said it was time \u201cto fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth.\u201d She then paused and said, \u201cthe privilege and pride of being an American.\u201d\n\nThat sentence is the most full-throated and sincere expression of American exceptionalism since the presidency of George W. Bush, and the most direct and unambiguous expression of that idea by a Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cI love our country with all my heart,\u201d she said a few seconds before, adding, \u201cWe are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nHard to say it more directly than that. That is in many ways the modern definition of American exceptionalism.\n\nThe idea of American exceptionalism has been mostly out of favor since it was seen as an underpinning of President Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. For Democrats, it has been a perilous concept for longer than that. American exceptionalism is the idea that the U.S., because of its unique history and origin, because of its founding documents, the Declaration and the Constitution, has a special role not only in the creation of modern democracy but in preserving it around the world. It\u2019s the idea that America is a moral beacon and has a providential role and responsibility to lead.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is a 20th century term, but the idea is older than the nation. Its inspiration comes from John Winthrop\u2019s famous 1630 sermon in which he said America \u201cshall be as a city upon a hill.\u201d It\u2019s a biblical reference that Ronald Reagan made famous and used hundreds of times in his political career. Reagan, who became the exemplar of exceptionalism, believed that Americans, as John Adams once said, were \u201cthe chosen people\u201d with a special destiny determined by the Almighty.\n\nBut the model of foreign policy exceptionalism comes from a different President: Woodrow Wilson. In trying to overcome American isolationism before World War I, it was Wilson who understood that he needed to appeal to American values\u2014the values of freedom, fairness, and equality, and an almost messianic sense of America\u2019s role in the world. This became known as foreign policy idealism, and every American President since Wilson has had to at least nod in that direction.\n\nFor the most part, American exceptionalists are, well, American. Foreigners tend to see the idea of American exceptionalism falling somewhere between naivet\u00e9 and narcissism. We are often regarded as hypocrites who tout our moral superiority while behaving in ways that are self-serving or damaging.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism became a campaign issue when Barack Obama was running for President in 2008. In an interview that year, Obama was asked whether he believed in American exceptionalism, and he replied, \u201cI believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.\u201d Well, let\u2019s just say that did not do the trick. In fact, his lukewarm embrace of the idea was seen as a rejection of American exceptionalism.\n\nI once heard Henry Kissinger say he thought Obama would be the first American President in his lifetime not to be an American exceptionalist. During the Republican primary in 2008, Mike Huckabee accused Obama of not being truly American, saying, \u201cTo deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation.\u201d The GOP turned the idea of exceptionalism into a political weapon. Their argument was, if you don\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism, you don\u2019t love this country and you don\u2019t deserve to lead it. Obama began to play defense and tried to embrace the idea of exceptionalism, as he said later that same year, \u201cOur exceptionalism must be based on our Constitution, our principles, our values, and our ideals.\u201d The subtext: It\u2019s not our size or military might that make us exceptional but our ideals, and the times we struggle to live up to those ideals, like the civil rights movement, are a part of that exceptionalism.\n\nRead More: How Kamala Harris Took \u2018Freedom\u2019 Back from the GOP\n\nHarris picks up where Obama left off but adds something new: Her\u2019s is a personal American exceptionalism, an exceptionalism seen through the prism of her own life and the immigrant experience. Her explanation of her own story suggests that what makes America exceptional is that it\u2019s a place where the child of an Indian immigrant mother and a Jamaican immigrant father can become the nominee for President.\n\nTraditionally, Americans of color were less enamored of the idea of American exceptionalism than white Americans. But recent data show that Americans of foreign and minority backgrounds have a higher degree of faith in America\u2019s promise than white Americans. A 2019 Cato Institute survey found that more immigrant citizens than native-born Americans are somewhat proud or very proud to be an American. A 2023 PRRI/Brookings survey found that more Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Black Americans than white Americans believe America\u2019s best days are ahead of us rather than behind us. And according to 2024 Pew Research Center polls, 75% of Indian Americans and 80% of Asian Americans\u2014higher percentages than white Americans\u2014say they have either achieved or are on their way to achieving the American Dream.\n\nHarris\u2019s embrace of American exceptionalism is a political twofer: It\u2019s a way to appeal both to some conservative voters who may have previously seen the Democratic Party as rejecting traditional red-white-and-blue patriotism and to the millions of legal immigrants who are indeed grateful for the privilege of being an American. In fact, the U.S. foreign-born population surpassed 46 million in 2022, the largest number in American history. That\u2019s almost 15% of the population, the greatest percentage of Americans with immigrant backgrounds since 1910. Naturalized American citizens constituted about 10% of the overall electorate in 2020, a record high. That percentage has only grown. That\u2019s a lot of voters, particularly in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada, which have hundreds of thousands of eligible immigrant voters.\n\nThe irony is that Donald Trump rejects the idea of American exceptionalism and is in fact an American declinist. He has said on numerous occasions that the American Dream is dead and that we are a failed nation. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan isn\u2019t an assertion of global leadership but rather a declaration of intent to withdraw and prioritize self-interest.\n\nThe first sentence of the 2016 platform of the Republican Party said, \u201cWe believe in American exceptionalism.\u201d Their nominee said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the term.\u201d And indeed he doesn\u2019t. When Trump was interviewed by Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News in 2017, O\u2019Reilly said \u201cPutin\u2019s a killer.\u201d Trump replied, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d He is a relativist about America, who doesn\u2019t think our values make us special but that the U.S. is just as morally compromised as other nations. The 2024 platform of the Republican Party doesn\u2019t mention \u201cexceptionalism.\u201d\n\nAuthoritarians don\u2019t like the idea of exceptionalism. Exceptionalism makes people feel special, it empowers them\u2014it promotes democracy. Just take it from Vladimir Putin, who wrote in a 2023 New York Times op-ed, \u201cIt is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.\u201d\n\nHarris used the term \u201cself-determination\u201d twice in her acceptance speech. Self-determination is the opposite of autocracy. It\u2019s a term that President Wilson referenced in his famous Fourteen Points speech that proposed the League of Nations, and it\u2019s a cardinal principle in international law. It is also a guiding principle of the immigrant\u2019s view of American exceptionalism, that here people can determine their own future. And that is who Harris was thinking of when she accepted the nomination. \u201cOn behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth,\u201d she said, \u201cI accept your nomination to be President of the United States.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Aug. 29\n\nThe original version of this story misidentified an American President in one instance. The author believes Kamala Harris has made the most \u201cfull-throated expression of American exceptionalism\u201d since the presidency of George W. Bush, not George H.W. Bush."

And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.\"\n\n'Next question, please,' Harris brushes off Trump's race comments\n\nHarris was asked to respond to former President Donald Trump's comments at the National Association of Black Journalists convention where he appeared to question Harris' race.\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said at the time.\n\nWhen asked about the comments by Bash, Harris responded, \"Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.\"\n\nThe CNN interview will air Thursday night at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates."

            "headline": "Kamala Harris\u2019s Gamble",
            "text": "In the first month of Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s improbable run for President, she allowed Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm about finally having a credible opponent to Donald Trump to define her candidacy. Once Joe Biden left the race and Harris let her intentions be known, the excitement vastly outweighed the need to know precisely what policies she was running on. Tens of thousands of people joined Zoom calls to raise funds and created networks aimed at supporting the Vice-President\u2019s run. Thousands more stood in line for hours to pack arenas for rallies, which became staging grounds for crafting the themes of her developing campaign.\n\nAt those rallies, the framing of her campaign came into focus. Harris adhered to typical liberal fare: raising the minimum wage and providing affordable housing and health care. She has been more pointed in her intentions to fight for abortion rights and to extend protections and rights to L.G.B.T.Q. people. By choosing as her running mate the genuinely populist governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, over the more moderate Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, Harris delighted progressives.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nBut the most excitement about Harris\u2019s surprise candidacy has been generated without her having to say a word. Her presence at the top of the ticket, as a biracial woman and the daughter of two immigrant parents, has served as a backlash to the backlash against 2020\u2019s national reckoning with the history of American racism. Even as Harris and Walz have deftly avoided any mention of race or racism in this contest, its centrality to the looming election is undeniable.\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party\u2019s long campaign to end affirmative action was finally realized by a U.S. Supreme Court packed with Trump appointees. Books about slavery and racism against African Americans and school curricula teaching Black history have been banned in some states and localities. In Florida, in an effort that has since been challenged in court but which captured the national mood, Republican legislators passed the so-called Stop WOKE Act, which tried to manage the teaching of Black history based on whether it was perceived to make white students feel guilty. Universities in states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Utah have closed centers and offices dedicated to diversity.\n\nSince Harris became the presumptive nominee, Trump has attacked her racial identity, intentionally mispronounced her name, and questioned her intelligence, going so far as to call her \u201cdumb.\u201d His running mate, J. D. Vance, has supported a national ban on abortion and described people without children as inferior to parents. Under these circumstances, supporting Harris can feel like an act of resistance.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention provided Harris with the opportunity to spell out the specifics of why she should be promoted to President. It was organized to project a new image of Harris as tough and, as her husband, Doug Emhoff, put it, \u201cready to lead.\u201d Democrats seized the opportunity to claim they were charting a new course for the country, emphasizing themes of joy and patriotism; the crowd periodically broke out into chants of \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d Love of country was laced throughout the speeches, in contrast to Trump\u2019s regular descriptions of the U.S. as a hellscape that only he can rescue. As Michelle Obama intoned, Harris \u201ctruly understands\u201d what has \u201calways made America great.\u201d The emotive goals of the Convention seemed to have been met, but what of the opportunity to map out the meaning of a Harris Presidency?\n\nFor all the talk about moving forward, the Democratic Party decided to feature the parts of its past that most troubled its core constituencies of Black and young voters. Bill Clinton made his mark on the Party by championing a turn away from social welfare and civil rights. His legacy includes policies that fuelled mass incarceration and demonized poor Black people, especially Black women, whom he made the focal point of his efforts to abolish welfare as an entitlement. During her campaign for the Presidency in 2016, Hillary Clinton was hounded by Black Lives Matter activists for referring to juveniles in 1996 as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Barack Obama may be adored by many, but it was under his Administration that Occupy Wall Street and the Black Lives Matter movement erupted, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises of his historic run for office.\n\nThat the Party featured the old guard while still claiming a new path reflected the tensions throughout the Convention: joy alongside Harris\u2019s bellicose promise of pursuing American values abroad with \u201cthe strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\u201d; challenges to misogyny and promotion of different kinds of family, but no concrete details on how Harris would address the crisis in child-care costs and the rising costs of living. The Convention featured four of the wrongly convicted, and since exonerated, Central Park Five before a segment that celebrated Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor. Most pointedly, speakers repeatedly framed the election as a struggle for democracy and a fight for freedom, yet the D.N.C. refused to give a single Palestinian American any time on the main stage. The refusal was in contrast to the Convention\u2019s parade of Republicans, who were given speaking slots because they rejected Trump.\n\nThese conflicting messages seemed intended to inspire and embolden the base while also reaching voters who have not yet made up their minds. This dual purpose left Harris ill-equipped to speak about how she and her party plan to address the central issues of the election, including the hardships driven by economic inequality and inflation. Instead, she offered vague platitudes, promising an \u201copportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed.\u201d Harris pledged to \u201cend\u201d the housing shortage, with no details of how she would do it. There was almost no attempt to address the social questions that so sharply defined the 2020 race, when Harris was selected as Vice-President. Then, Harris decried \u201cstructural racism,\u201d injustice in our criminal-justice system, and \u201cexcessive use of force by police.\u201d In sum, she concluded, \u201cthere is no vaccine for racism. We\u2019ve gotta do the work.\u201d The new Democratic Party platform also featured this dramatic shift, burying the fight for racial justice of 2020. For the first time since 2012, the Party\u2019s platform does not oppose the death penalty; it calls for more police, without emphasizing police reform.\n\nTo be sure, much has changed since 2020. But Harris is gambling that the millions of people who marched in search of resolution to the crisis of racism that year will simply move forward on this well-trodden path to the future. The Democratic Party is gambling that the nomination of a Black and Indian woman alone will satisfy the desires for racial justice. It is a risky strategy. The G.O.P. is prepared to flood the airwaves with an assortment of comments that Harris has made that will validate the \u201cliberal\u201d label. As one G.O.P. strategist put it, \u201cThe archive is deep.\u201d In Harris\u2019s previous run for President, she supported universal health care and free tuition for students at public colleges and universities. She raised the possibility of \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She opposed fracking and called for an end to juvenile incarceration.\n\nEven though Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren are among the most popular Democrats in the country, and an unabashed strategy of leveraging public dollars to rebuild the U.S. economy and promising to address racial discrimination produced one of the largest voter turnouts in American history, Harris and the Party leadership have acquiesced to the terms of the Republican backlash and rejected anything having to do with the successful 2020 election. Instead of explaining why she has supported these positions, in hopes of persuading an electorate desperate for change and possibly open to her reasoning, Harris is trying to reinvent herself on the fly."

            "headline": "What I Heard at Swifties for Kamala",
            "text": "You might not be shocked to learn that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s favorite Taylor Swift song is about cosmic justice.\n\n\u201cI love \u2018Karma,\u2019\u201d the senator from Massachusetts said last night during a Zoom event for a group called Swifties for Kamala. \u201cAnd I have a thing or two to say about private equity!\u201d The 34,000 attendees probably would have cheered, but, as is typical for such a massive webinar, only the organizers had control of the microphone and camera. Warren was undaunted by the lack of response. \u201cIt is going to be a tough fight ahead,\u201d she said, winding up. \u201cThere are only 24 hours in a day\u2014or 144 \u2018All Too Well\u2019 10-minute versions.\u201d [Pause for no laughter.] \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, just like you\u2019ve done every time before, we will push this boulder up the hill.\u201d\n\nOnly a die-hard Swiftie would have caught all the references in Warren\u2019s words, which included a jab at the investment group backing Swift\u2019s nemesis, Scooter Braun, and a lyric from a Swift deep cut said to be about the singer\u2019s beef with Kim Kardashian. It seems safe to assume that Warren did not write all of these quips herself. But she would not be the only speaker on the call whose staffers had squeezed an unconscionable number of jokes into last night\u2019s remarks.\n\nRead: The Millennial cringe of Taylor Swift\n\nIdentity-based calls to action have been all the rage in this season of Democratic politics, with events like White Dudes for Harris and Win With Black Women drawing tens of thousands of attendees. Although America\u2019s Swifties are not an ethnic or racial group, they are arguably a religious one. Last night\u2019s call was an attempt to harness their unflagging devotion to the pop star and put it to political use.\n\nThe whole thing was, somehow, even cringier than I had anticipated\u2014and, as a Swiftie myself, I am familiar with the fandom\u2019s extreme dorkiness. The organizers looked startlingly young and inexperienced\u2014introducing lawmakers in shaky voices, clearly nervous to be blindly addressing thousands of viewers. They passed the mic too often, rambled, and misspoke. And the middle-aged politicians were working painfully hard to demonstrate fluency in the dialect of Swiftworld.\n\nStill, the cringe seemed, at least partly, the point. Like the broader Harris campaign, these organizers leaned into the awk. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about how joy isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d Irene Kim, a Swifties for Kamala co-founder and its executive director, said on the call, citing a recent New York Times op-ed. \u201cBut that definitely hasn\u2019t been our experience!\u201d\n\nThe project began with a post by a 22-year-old named Emerald Medrano, who runs a popular Swift fan account. \u201cI feel like us U.S. swifties should mass organize and help campaign for Kamala Harris,\u201d he wrote on X in July. Soon, Swifties for Kamala was born: a partnership of fans, some of whom run social-media accounts and others who have experience in Democratic politics. A month later, the group has 71,000 followers on X, a Substack newsletter, and a Discord channel.\n\nThe organizers seem to assume that Swift, who backed Joe Biden in 2020, will support the Democratic nominee. But Swift has not actually endorsed anyone yet, a fact that went unacknowledged in last night\u2019s call. Her support in the race is highly sought after; last week, Donald Trump shared tacky AI deepfakes to claim he had the pop star\u2019s backing. During the Democratic National Convention, rumors swirled of a surprise musical performance: Would it be Taylor? (No.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping things political, but also everything has a layer of Swiftiness to it,\u201d Annie Wu Henry, the campaign manager at Swifties for Kamala, who has also worked for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive lawmakers, said during last night\u2019s call. Organizers wore Swift-themed cardigans and displayed glittery #47s on their hands, in reference to what could be Harris\u2019s place in the presidential timeline. They encouraged viewers in the Zoom chat to chip in either $13 or $19.89\u2014both important Swiftian numbers\u2014and, like Taylor, they frequently folded their hands into hearts for the camera.\n\nRead: Taylor Swift\u2019s post-Reputation approach to politics\n\nThe Zoom event was light on policy talk, heavy on allusion. After Warren spoke, Representative Becca Balint of Vermont offered a pep talk: \u201cThe MAGA movement will be defeated by our dominoes, cascading in a line!\u201d she said, quoting the song \u201cMastermind.\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York read off a few jokes. \u201cKarma is a relaxing thought, but for Donald Trump it\u2019s not\u2014facts!\u201d she said, to the ever-silent audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re in line to vote, stay, stay, stay!\u201d When Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts showed up, he revealed that his favorite Swift song is, oddly, \u201cSnow on the Beach\u201d\u2014because it highlights the risks of global warming. \u201cClimate change is threatening our favorite phenomenon,\u201d the senator said, before adding that the waters outside Swift\u2019s beach house in Rhode Island are \u201csome of the fastest-warming \u2026 in the world!\u201d\n\nJust like a Taylor Swift marketing campaign, the Zoom call promised surprises and exciting guests. There would be a big announcement at 8 p.m., organizers teased, and a very special person would wrap up the call at about 8:30 p.m. One special speaker was the singer-songwriter Carole King, now in her 80s, who materialized like a yellow-haired fairy godmother. King, who called Swift her \u201cmusical and songwriting granddaughter,\u201d sang part of the chorus from \u201cShake It Off,\u201d and offered advice to first-time campaign volunteers: \u201cThe key to door-knocking is asking a good question and then listening.\u201d She urged Swifties to ask voters what they might find in common with Harris. \u201cYou\u2019re building a bridge to that person,\u201d King said\u2014aware, apparently, of how much Swifties appreciate bridges.\n\nAt 8 o\u2019clock, the big announcement was made: Merch drop! Swiftie T-shirts and tote bags reading In My Voting Era were for sale\u2014no affiliation, organizers carefully reminded fans, with Swift herself.\n\nNearly two hours into the call, the surprise final guest\u2014Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a rising Democratic star\u2014still hadn\u2019t appeared. The leaders of Swifties for Kamala began signing off. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed, and so happy and fully immersed in Swiftie-ism right now,\u201d Medrano said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to paint the town blue, and it\u2019s going to be the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened in this country!\u201d\n\nThe letdown didn\u2019t kill their enthusiasm\u2014with Swifties, it never does. The group had raised money at a clip that the capitalist icon herself would have been proud of: The night\u2019s fundraising haul totaled an auspicious $122,000. If Harris is hoping that joy and\u2014yes\u2014cringe can help her win the White House, she\u2019s got the right fandom on her side."

            "headline": "Seven Questions That Should Be Easy for Harris to Answer",
            "text": "A presidential nominee normally accounts for their past actions in public life and clarifies their plans for the future. This year, Kamala Harris ran in no primaries, and since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not had a formal press conference where she would be expected to answer questions from reporters. She has not sat down for an in-depth interview on television or with a major paper such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. (CNN recently announced that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will be interviewed by one of the network\u2019s anchors this week.) This avoidance may be a strategy to keep the \u201cgood vibes\u201d of her campaign going, but it does a disservice to voters and bodes poorly for how transparent and forthcoming Harris would be if she wins the presidency.\n\nBefore Harris was vice president or a U.S. senator, she spent roughly a quarter century in the criminal-justice system\u2013\u2013she was California\u2019s attorney general, San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, and a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, a job she took shortly after graduating from law school. Her work as a prosecutor constitutes the bulk of her career. She wrote a 2009 book, Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor\u2019s Plan to Make Us Safer, laying out her policy views. And she has talked a lot about criminal-justice issues in her years as a national politician.\n\nYet even her positions on important criminal-justice issues remain unclear, because of inconsistencies in her actions and statements and failures to address tough questions posed by critics of her record.\n\nRead: The prosecutor vs. the felon\n\nI sent the Harris campaign questions that voters deserve to have answered: about her record as a \u201ctop cop,\u201d about apparent changes in her rhetoric and positions, and about what policies she would pursue if elected. At the time of publication, her campaign hasn\u2019t provided any answers, but should that change, this story will be updated. Here are some of the questions I asked, edited for clarity and concision:\n\nDaniel Larsen, an unsympathetic defendant, was convicted of felony possession of a knife in 1999 after police testified that they saw him throw the weapon under a car in a Los Angeles parking lot. He got 28 years in prison. But as it turned out, a witness\u2013\u2013James McNutt, a retired Army sergeant first class and former police chief\u2013\u2013had been in the parking lot that night with his wife; both gave sworn statements that they saw a different man, William Hewitt, throw the knife under the car. Hewitt swore that\u2019s what happened too. So did Hewitt\u2019s girlfriend. Yet at trial, Larsen\u2019s attorney failed to identify or call any of those witnesses; he also failed to request that the knife be examined for fingerprints or to argue that it belonged to someone else. He was later disbarred for failing other clients.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, just before you became attorney general of California, Judge Suzanne H. Segal ruled that Larsen\u2019s case was one of those \u201cextraordinary cases where the petitioner asserts his innocence and establishes that the court cannot have confidence in the contrary finding of guilt.\u201d She declared that \u201cno reasonable juror would have found Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that he \u201cclearly received ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d The state was ordered to retry the case or release Larsen.\n\n\n\nBut while you were attorney general, your office filed an appeal attempting to block Larsen\u2019s release, because he hadn\u2019t filed his claim for relief in a timely manner. In other words, your office sought to keep a man in prison on procedural grounds, despite strong evidence of his innocence. As a result, Larsen spent two more years in prison, until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he had cleared the threshold for producing proof of innocence. Even then, your office continued to litigate the matter, arguing before a three-judge panel that \u201cone reasonable juror could still vote to convict.\u201d When that failed, forcing the prisoner\u2019s release, your office worked to prevent Larsen from receiving funds earmarked for people who are wrongly convicted of crimes.\n\n\n\nWhy did your office work so hard to keep a man in prison after it was clear that he didn\u2019t commit the crime that put him there?\n\nIn 2010, when you were San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, a scandal rocked the crime lab run by the San Francisco Police Department. A technician who analyzed drugs was deemed \u201cincreasingly UNDEPENDABLE for testimony\u201d by an assistant DA, a co-worker observed that the area where she tested drugs was in \u201cdisarray,\u201d an audit found missing evidence, and the technician\u2019s sister reported that she had a vial of cocaine at her house. She ultimately acknowledged taking evidence home for personal use. Her behavior raised the prospect of unreliable analysis and testimony in hundreds of cases. But neither you nor your office notified defense attorneys in potentially affected cases.\n\n\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported on a judicial rebuke you received, writing that the judge \u201cconcluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys\u201d about problems in the crime lab, violating the rights of defendants. At the time, you defended your behavior and criticized the judge as biased. Later, while you were running for president in 2020, The Washington Post asked about the matter, and reported that you \u201ctook responsibility for the failings,\u201d including your failure to develop a written policy so that your office \u201cwould notify defendants about problems with witnesses and evidence.\u201d You told the Post, \u201cNo excuses. The buck stops with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the future, if a federal prosecutor is found to violate a defendant\u2019s rights, what consequences should he or she face?\n\nIn Smart on Crime, you championed putting more police officers on the street, arguing that it would mean faster responses to assaults and robberies and fewer quality-of-life crimes. \u201cVirtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see police officers walking a beat,\u201d you wrote. \u201cThis is as true in economically poor neighborhoods as wealthy ones.\u201d But in a June 2020 radio interview, you said, \u201cIt is old thinking, it is outdated, and is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.\u201d That same month, appearing on The View, you said: \u201cIn many cities in America, over one-third of their city budget goes to police \u2026 What are we doing? What about the money going to social services? What about the money going to helping people with job training? What about helping with the mental-health issues that communities are being plagued with?\u201d\n\n\n\nDid something cause you to change your position in the years after you published your book? If so, what? Do you still believe that cities should pay to put more police officers on the street?\n\nWhen you were attorney general of California, the ACLU faulted you for failing to protect the privacy of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cOn your watch as California\u2019s top cop, law enforcement agencies up and down the state have been secretly using social media surveillance software that has been marketed to monitor protests and activists of color,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHighly invasive facial recognition that may have a disproportionate impact on Californians of color is also being quietly used in several of our largest cities and counties. As the Attorney General, your leadership is urgently needed to address the lack of transparency, accountability, and oversight of law enforcement surveillance technology in order to fulfill your duty to safeguard the privacy, free speech, and civil rights of Californians.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat, if anything, did you do in response to that letter? And how does that response reflect your position on how transparent the government should be about the surveillance technologies that it uses?\n\nAs attorney general of California, you were criticized for taking a hands-off approach to credible abuse allegations against local prosecutors and police. \u201cHarris sent an unmistakable signal,\u201d the investigative reporter R. Scott Moxley wrote in a scathing 2019 OC Weekly article. \u201cUnder her watch, police-agency employees in California were free to commit perjury\u2014even in death-penalty cases, as they did in Orange County.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter multiple Oakland police officers were accused of having sex with an underage girl, \u201ccivil rights lawyers and California residents had been pleading for then-Attorney General Kamala Harris to open an independent investigation into the situation, since it spanned several police departments and involved allegations of coverups,\u201d Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote in Reason magazine. \u201cBut she never responded to the petitions and pleas asking her to look into systemic sexual exploitation by state agents in Oakland.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Campos, a former San Francisco supervisor and police commissioner and a vice chair of the California Democratic Party, told The New York Times, \u201cWe never thought we had an ally in the district attorney \u2026 When she had the opportunity to do something about police accountability, she was either not visible, or when she was, she was on the wrong side.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow would you answer critics who say that you did too little to police the police, and if elected president, what approach would you take to federal oversight of law enforcement?\n\nDavid Daleiden is an anti-abortion activist. In 2015, he pretended to be a representative of a fetal-tissue-procurement company and met with Planned Parenthood, and later released surreptitiously taken videos to show those staffers discussing the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the videos were misleadingly edited. On July 31, 2015, the National Abortion Federation filed a lawsuit claiming that Daleiden violated privacy laws when taking the videos. As AG, you opened a criminal investigation. Daleiden was indicted by your successor. In a lawsuit, Daleiden says that he was targeted for prosecution because Planned Parenthood is an ideological ally that has given you campaign contributions.\n\n\n\nUndercover videos are sometimes used by journalists and activists on the right and the left. The people taking the videos argue that doing so is in the public interest and that they are exposing misconduct. Do you favor or oppose laws that make it unlawful for journalists and activists to surreptitiously capture video and release it to the public? How do you propose ensuring that such laws are enforced in an evenhanded manner?\n\nAs San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, you prosecuted parents for their children\u2019s habitual failure to attend school. Do you think district attorneys nationwide should pursue similar policies or that the risks of overly harsh enforcement are too high?\n\nRead: Why Kamala Harris\u2019s politics are so hard to pin down\n\nCandidates aren\u2019t informed about every issue. Sometimes, a reasonable answer is \u201cI have to think about that and get back to you.\u201d But Harris is well versed in all of these issues, having pondered them for years. Voters deserve to know where she stands on them today."

            "headline": "U.S. Army Confirms Trump Staffer \u2018Pushed\u2019 Arlington Staffer Before Filming TikTok Ad",
            "text": "Donald Trump is facing new questions on Thursday about a stunt the former president filmed at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week. Photos of the 45th president giving a big thumbs up were the first to surface in an incredibly tacky, if typical, move for Trump. But new revelations from that day have been trickling out, including allegations of a physical altercation between Trump\u2019s staff and a staff member at Arlington, as well as the fact that Trump likely broke federal law while filming the ad at the cemetery.\n\nIt all started Monday when Trump appeared at Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony wreath for 13 U.S. military service members killed at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan during the American withdrawal in 2021. Federal regulations prohibit the filming of campaign commercials and the production of publicity material, but Trump brought along a crew to document his little stunt.\n\nAs the New York Times points out, Trump was in a heavily restricted part of the cemetery known as Section 60, which is primarily for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a staff member at Arlington approached his camera crew. There was a physical altercation, with Trump\u2019s staff insisting they should be allowed to film in the restricted area for their stupid little commercial.\n\nThe Arlington staff member has reportedly declined to press charges against Trump because it \u201ccould subject her to retaliation from Trump supporters,\u201d as the Times reports. And that\u2019s a reasonable fear, given the fact that Trump is the guy who tried to literally overthrow the U.S. government on January 6, 2021, and his followers are some of the most violent extremists around.\n\nThe Trump camp has tried to play down the incident and campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even slandered the Arlington staff member as mentally unstable on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump\u2019s team during a very solemn ceremony,\u201d Cheung told NPR.\n\nCheung added to NPR, \u201cWe are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made.\u201d But no footage showing details of the physical altercation has been released yet and NPR writes that when a reporter asked to see the footage, the Trump campaign declined.\n\nThe Army released a new statement about the incident on Thursday to defend the unnamed staff member at Arlington (ANC), who was simply trying to enforce the rules.\n\n\u201cParticipants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\u201d an unnamed Army spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation\u2019s fallen deserve,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe Trump campaign has released several staged videos from that day, and Trump himself says in one of the videos he\u2019s churned out for social media that, \u201cWe lost 13 people great, great people, what a horrible day it was,\u201d referring to the last day U.S. forces were officially in Afghanistan under wartime conditions. And then Trump insisted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose one person in 18 months and then they took over that disaster of leaving Afghanistan.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true, of course. The Associated Press fact-checked his claim back in 2022 and reported there was no 18-month period during his presidency without casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nBut all of that is really beside the point. Trump clearly broke the law by trying this idiotic move at a place widely revered as a site of quiet contemplation. As he does with everything, Trump turned it into a circus all about himself.\n\nThe law Trump broke by filming at the cemetery is 32 CFR \u00a7 553.32, according to the Washington Post, which prohibits any politician from engaging in political activity at the site. The newspaper talked with legal experts who emphatically explained that \u201cif the campaign was filming during the wreath-laying ceremony for partisan political activities, that would be a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nTrump is struggling in the national polls, as he and Kamala Harris have just a little over two months before Election Day. And it\u2019s clear that Trump will do anything he can\u2014including breaking federal law\u2014in a desperate bid to retake power. With any luck, the former president will fail in those efforts. But things could get a lot weirder before they get any better on November 8."

Read preview\n\nAs a retirement tsunami looms in the US, life after work is top of mind for many. And some Americans worry they'll survive longer than Social Security.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies released its 2024 retirement outlook for the middle class. It delved into the financial concerns and retirement preparations for those with annual household incomes of $50,000 to $199,999 using a sample of just over 10,000 people \u2014 about 5,000 of whom fell into the middle-class category.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs it turns out, middle-class workers have plenty of worries about retirement. Their greatest fear is outliving their savings and investments.\n\nAmong those with household incomes of $50,000 to $99,000 and those with incomes of $100,000 to $199,000, 40% of both groups said that sticking around longer than their nest eggs was one of their greatest fears in retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat comes as middle-class Americans expect to live to a median age of 90, over a decade more than the US's current life expectancy of 77.5. Americans aged 65, which is about the average retirement age, can expect to live an average of 18.4 more years \u2014 a significant amount of time to rely on savings or Social Security.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that middle-class Americans are worried about the future of Social Security, which often fills the gap between retirees' savings and their financial needs. Broadly, 39% of those in the middle-class cohort said that one of their greatest fears in retirement was that Social Security would be reduced \u2014 or simply cease to exist \u2014 in the future.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe uncertain future of Social Security has long had older generations concerned. According to the latest Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees report, the program will only be able to pay out full benefits for the next 11 years \u2014 meaning that after that point, benefits will dwindle if Congress does not step in.\n\nThat's particularly troubling for Americans who have relied primarily on Social Security benefits to stay afloat financially in retirement. In a recent NerdWallet study of 2,100 adults, just 30% of respondents said they believe Social Security alone will allow them to live comfortably in retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne 63-year-old previously told Business Insider that she's \"incredibly scared\" Social Security won't be enough to cover her expenses. \"I think I'll probably need to work until I die because there's no money,\" she said.\n\nThe report also found that worries about Social Security are a primary reason some middle-class people plan to work after retirement. Of the 52% who plan to work after they retire, 55% plan to do so because of the extra income, while 33% are concerned Social Security benefits will be lower than expected.\n\nWith the presidential election quickly approaching, the fate of Social Security and Medicare is a hot-button issue for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. While Trump has vowed to protect benefits for older Americans, Democrats have accused the GOP of threatening to cut the benefits and raise the retirement age. The issue is likely to get more heated as November gets closer.\n\nAre you worried about outliving your retirement savings?

            "headline": "The Tech-Trump Alliance",
            "text": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nSome of the most prominent figures in Silicon Valley are enthusiastically supporting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. And Trump\u2019s running mate, J. D. Vance, is a former venture capitalist with deep ties to the right-wing tech billionaire Peter Thiel; as my colleague Ali Breland put it in a recent article, Silicon Valley \u201cgot their guy.\u201d I spoke with Ali, who covers tech and right-wing politics, about the long-simmering ideas animating Silicon Valley\u2019s shift to the right.\n\nReturning to Their Roots\n\nLora Kelley: Many people think of the Silicon Valley tech scene as a pretty liberal one. Is that assumption true? And if so, how did we get to this point where some of the most visible leaders in tech are backing Trump?\n\nAli Breland: There is a shift happening. I don\u2019t want to discount that. But this, to me, is also indicative of some segments of Silicon Valley returning to their roots.\n\nIf you look back at some of the original literature that was coming out of the tech scene\u2014the early issues of Wired magazine, or the Whole Earth Catalog\u2014they featured not necessarily hard-right ideologies but these free-market, libertarian ideologies. This kind of stuff was always flowing through Silicon Valley, even when tech executives were voting for and supporting Democrats. A lot of tech companies\u2019 business models involve finding ways to circumvent regulation and then hiring workforces that are not on staff or are extremely difficult to unionize.\n\nThe tech industry supported Democrats such as Barack Obama in part because he allowed that culture to exist within his version of liberalism. Tech titans perceive Kamala Harris and Joe Biden to be chipping away at that flexibility, so they\u2019re turning to a right that they see as more friendly to tech.\n\nLora: Is the selection of Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate hastening this turn?\n\nAli: Elon Musk was very excited when Trump picked Vance; he posted on X that the ticket \u201cresounds with victory.\u201d Some tech people seem to be feeling: He\u2019s one of us. He\u2019s connected to Peter Thiel. He worked out here. He believes in what we believe. There are certainly people coalescing around the campaign because of that.\n\nVance is where he is in large part because of Thiel\u2019s $15 million donation to his Senate campaign. Even though Thiel has said he isn\u2019t donating this cycle, the 2021 campaigns of Vance and Blake Masters were a warm-up moment. Venture capitalists were giving many millions more to the right than to Democrats in that cycle.\n\nLora: How pervasive is the support for Trump in Silicon Valley? Is the entire sector shifting? Or is it more that a few loud voices are getting lots of attention?\n\nAli: There are different factions. A lot of tech workers still skew left, or believe in a liberal version of the free market. And a lot of the tech-titan set are still Democrats: There\u2019s Aaron Levie of the software company Box; Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, is the mega Democratic donor of Silicon Valley; Sheryl Sandberg has publicly supported Kamala Harris.\n\nBut we are also seeing a group of right-backing tech titans expressing a new rhetoric that didn\u2019t have a place in Silicon Valley before. Thiel, for example, has been pushing his far-right beliefs into the ether for a long time. At one point, he was treated as an oddity. Now he\u2019s in step with the prevailing ideological movement among tech billionaires.\n\nLora: What are some of the ideas animating this new rhetoric?\n\nAli: In the techno-optimist manifesto that Marc Andreessen released last fall, he cites Nick Land, a British philosopher who became important in the intellectual development of the far right. He also cites F. T. Marinetti, who was an Italian futurist and fascist. And he quotes Friedrich Nietzsche, who is not inherently right-wing, but who is having a moment among this set of right-wing advocates of eugenics and a \u201cnatural order\u201d who want to see \u201cstrongmen\u201d take over, and who see feminists and the DEI movement as getting in the way of the country\u2019s true potential. I don\u2019t know if Andreessen believes in all of that. But that appeal to the strongman is indicative of the new right-wing thinking that\u2019s taking shape in Silicon Valley.\n\nLora: Some of this seems to be about ideology and values. But what are some of the more immediate policy concerns that are pushing tech titans toward the right?\n\nAli: A lot of tech leaders want to be left alone and unregulated. And there\u2019s lately been a shift in how the industry perceives Democrats to be approaching tech. Biden\u2019s appointment of Lina Khan, a proponent of stringent antitrust law, to lead the Federal Trade Commission is something tech people bring up a lot, and cite as an example of Biden not being interested in helping the industry. Even Andreessen has suggested that he misses the old Democrats who gave tech this cozy place and let them do what they want.\n\nThere is also a large crypto contingent that sees Biden as aggressively anti-crypto, and they\u2019re very skeptical of his appointment of Gary Gensler as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They\u2019re a bit more cautiously optimistic about Harris. But they still see Trump as the clearest path toward a low-regulation environment that\u2019s good for them.\n\nClearly, there is an aesthetic sensibility that crypto people appreciate about Trump, too. There\u2019s a troll-y aspect, and both Trump\u2019s MAGA base and the crypto community have ties to 4chan. Still, in past election cycles, crypto communities were not broadly pro-Trump, because there was no clear edge for them and their own material interests. Now some tech leaders see Trump as a way to satisfy those interests.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday\u2019s News\n\nThe U.S. Army said that an Arlington National Cemetery employee, who tried to ensure that Donald Trump\u2019s team adhered to the cemetery\u2019s rules against political activity during his recent visit, was \u201cabruptly pushed aside.\u201d An interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will air tonight on CNN. They answered questions about their plans for the White House, why Harris changed her position on decriminalizing illegal border crossings, and Trump\u2019s attacks on her racial identity.

Jetzt deutete er einen Sexskandal an.\n\nDonald Trump versucht weiter, mit derben Kommentaren die Aufmerksamkeit im US-Wahlkampf auf sich zu ziehen. Auf der von ihm mitbegr\u00fcndeten Plattform \"Truth Social\" waren Andeutungen zu lesen, wonach sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten die politische Karriere von Kamala Harris bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten.\n\nAnspielungen auf Sex-Skandal von Bill Clinton\n\nIn dem Post des republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Harris zu sehen, auf dem sie neben der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton steht. Dazu der Kommentar: \"Lustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben ...\"\n\nDie Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sexskandal, in den Clintons Mann und Ex-Pr\u00e4sident Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 bis 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Die Andeutungen sind in dem Post nicht mit Quellen belegt, werden aber dennoch von Trump-Anh\u00e4ngern geteilt.\n\nTrump verfasste den Beitrag nicht selbst. Dass er ihn auf seinem offiziellen Truth-Social-Account verbreitete, ist dennoch bemerkenswert. Der Republikaner verunglimpft seine demokratische Gegnerin im Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Unter anderem bezeichnet er sie als \"verr\u00fcckt\" und \"dumm\".\n\nTrump hat Harris auch schon mit Blick auf ihre Hautfarbe und Herkunft attackiert und unter anderem behauptet, die 59-J\u00e4hrige sei \"vor einigen Jahren pl\u00f6tzlich schwarz\" geworden. Verbale Angriffe sexueller Art haben eine neue Qualit\u00e4t.\n\nBei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Chicago kommentierte Trump die Hautfarbe von Kamala Harris.\n\nImmer wieder pers\u00f6nliche Angriffe - trotz Mahnungen\n\nMehrere Republikaner hatten Trump zuletzt \u00f6ffentlich dazu geraten, weniger pers\u00f6nliche Attacken gegen Harris von sich zu geben, sondern mehr inhaltliche Punkte zu machen. Trump wurde k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Pressekonferenz auf diese Mahnungen angesprochen, tat solche Ratschl\u00e4ge jedoch ab.\n\n\"Ich glaube, ich habe ein Recht darauf, sie pers\u00f6nlich zu attackieren\", sagte der 78-J\u00e4hrige mit Blick auf Harris und den Wahlkampf und schob nach: \"Ich muss es auf meine Art machen.\"\n\nSchon im Wahlkampf 2016 hatte Trump mit einer vulg\u00e4ren Aussage f\u00fcr Furore gesorgt, dass er Frauen \u00fcberall anfassen k\u00f6nne, auch zwischen den Beinen. Die Amerikaner w\u00e4hlten ihn damals trotzdem zum Pr\u00e4sidenten."

In court papers, Special Counsel Jack Smith said this latest action was an effort to respect and implement the Supreme Court holdings. The new charges specify when prosecutors think Trump was acting as a candidate seeking political office and not as the President. If he wins the election in November, Trump could order the Justice Department to dismiss the case. If he loses, Johnson says all the legal wrangling could get even more intense.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo members of Trump\u2019s campaign staff had a verbal and physical altercation with an official at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday while Trump was attending a ceremony honoring 13 troops killed in Afghanistan in 2021.

You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.\n\nEarlier this year, Donald Trump's social media company was worth something like $9 billion.\n\nBut that was then, and its stock has been sinking since: Now investors think Trump Media & Technology Group Corp \u2014 the company that runs Truth Social, Trump's Twitter clone \u2014 is worth a mere $4 billion. Today its stock closed at just above $20 a share, the lowest it has been since the company had its equivalent of an IPO in March.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nTo start, a caveat we've mentioned before: DJT is a meme stock. Investors aren't valuing it based on the company's financials, which are very meager at best. They think it's worth something because other people think it's worth something, and that collective fantasy will work right up until it doesn't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo trying to figure out why DJT is moving up or down on any given day isn't likely to lead to a satisfactory answer. Mostly you're going to get something along these lines: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nStill. We can at least acknowledge that DJT has been sliding for quite some time. So there's something going on.\n\nOne reason Trump's stock may be moving down is that lots of people who own Trump stock are Trump fans, and/or people betting that Trump will win the November election. But it has been harder to be in one of those groups recently: Since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden as Trump's opponent, Trump has been losing ground in the polls, and now both The New York Times and pollster Nate Silver see him as a slight underdog.\n\nSo if DJT is a proxy for Trump's election chances, it would make sense that it has been limping recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other very plausible reason that Trump stock is moving down is that investors may be worried about Trump selling some of his shares in the company. This could lead to other investors selling, which would have a cascading effect on the share price.\n\nTrump currently owns about 60% of Truth Social, which means his stake is worth about $2.4 billion. He's been restricted from selling any shares because of a lock-up restriction, which are common in public offerings. But the lock-up period could end as soon as September 20 \u2014 hence people trying to get out of the stock before he does.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere are two arguments against that theory, by the way: The first is that the lock-up period has been public knowledge since Truth Social first went public, so why bail now? The second is that Trump knows that if he does sell stock \u2014 and particularly if he sells a lot of stock \u2014 that the stock will really collapse. Because all but the most die-hard Trump fans will see it as the end of the company.\n\nSo there's a real tension there: Does Trump keep his theoretical $2.4 billion stake intact? Or does he try to turn it into actual money, and risk making the overall value much less?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any case, it's possible that both of the ideas above \u2014 Trump's declining political fortune, and the idea that he may be ready to trigger a big sell-off himself \u2014 are true. Or maybe there's something else at work that we have yet to see.\n\nThe only thing we know for certain is that if you bought Trump stock in late March and haven't sold it since then, you are down by more than 50%. We don't give investment advice around here. But don't say we didn't warn you."

            "text": "From the Gaza war to immigration to inflation, Harris is yet to spell out how she will accomplish her agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris will sit down for her first major broadcast interview since she became the face of the Democratic Party following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nShe will be joined by her running mate, Tim Walz, for the interview with CNN.\n\nUntil now, Harris has taken a cautious approach towards the press, much like Biden, who has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than any of the past seven US presidents, Axios reported, citing presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar.\n\nHarris\u2019s own sparse engagement with the media has come under scrutiny, especially from the Republicans. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to do a news conference; she\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference,\u201d Republican challenger Donald Trump said during a news conference of his own on August 15.\n\nTo be sure, Harris has spoken on several key issues that polls suggest matter to American voters, in campaign rallies and policy speeches. But without the cross-questioning that an interview allows, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee\u2019s positions on critical subjects remain ambiguous.\n\nSo when is the interview and what are some of the questions Harris has yet to clearly answer?\n\nWhen is Harris\u2019s CNN interview?\n\nHarris will speak to CNN\u2019s anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash alongside the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, at 9pm (01:00 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t be silent\u2019 on Gaza: How will she speak up?\n\nOn July 26, following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, Harris pledged not to stay silent on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,\u201d she told reporters. Yet, simultaneously, she pledged unwavering commitment to Israel.\n\n''I have had an unwavering commitment to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel.'' US VP Kamala Harris says she expressed her 'serious concerns' to Israeli PM Netanyahu about the 'scale of human suffering in Gaza.' pic.twitter.com/1U0KErqiDL \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 26, 2024\n\nIn the month since she made this statement, however, Harris\u2019s relative silence on Gaza has come under fire from critics who have questioned whether Harris\u2019s policy on Israel\u2019s war will be any different from Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo far, the answer, many believe, seems to be a firm no.\n\nAmid speculation that she might at least consider using restrictions on arms sales to Israel as leverage to convince the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop massacres of Palestinians, her adviser on national security made clear that Harris had no such plans.\n\n\u201cShe does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\u201d Phil Gordon, the adviser, said on August 8.\n\n.@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law. \u2014 Phil Gordon (@PhilGordon46) August 8, 2024\n\nAt this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which was held from August 19 to August 22 in Chicago, Harris once again simultaneously pledged support for Israel and expressed sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the Democrats refused to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the convention, while the parents of an Israeli-American captive held in Gaza were allowed to take the stage.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters rallied outside the DNC venue on all three days but were blocked from marching too close to the venue by police. Many warned that they would not support Harris in the November vote unless she ends unconditional support for Israel.\n\nHow will she ban \u2018price gouging\u2019?\n\nOn August 16, Harris proposed a ban on \u201cprice gouging\u201d by food suppliers and grocery stores.\n\nPrice gouging refers to dramatically raising prices to \u201cunfair levels\u201d in response to short-term high demand or scarcity \u2013 often following disasters, such as flooding. While several states already restrict the practice for some goods considered essential, there is no federal law barring it.\n\nThe proposal could be popular. High grocery bill inflation is a key concern for many voters. Under Biden\u2019s administration, grocery prices have gone up by 21 percent as part of an inflation surge.\n\nBut Harris has not spelt out how exactly she would go about enacting this ban on price gouging, earning her backlash from political critics, as well as industry.\n\nIn a release last week, the Trump campaign called her plan an example of \u201ccommunist price controls\u201d.\n\nIndustrialists and economists also said the plan could do more harm than good.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan is vague, but a central part of it involves getting the US Congress to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging in food and grocery sectors, similar to legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last year.\n\nYet political analysts point out that such legislation has almost no chance of passing in Congress \u2014 raising questions about the sincerity of Harris\u2019s proposal.\n\nWill she build a border wall?\n\nHarris has flip-flopped on the topic of immigration.\n\nDuring the DNC, she pledged that she would sign the now-defunct bipartisan border security bill that Trump wanted to terminate out of fears that it would benefit Democrats.\n\nThis bill would have allocated $20m towards security measures at the southern border with Mexico. The bill also set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for the construction of a border wall that was a signature project undertaken by Trump, and criticised by many Democrats.\n\nIndeed, during Trump\u2019s administration, Harris had called the idea of the wall \u201cun-American\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, she wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won\u2019t make us any safer.\u201d\n\nWhen she declared her candidacy for her 2020 presidential race in 2019, she called the wall Trump\u2019s \u201cmedieval vanity project\u201d.\n\nBesides pledging support for the bill that funds the wall, there are other indicators of Harris\u2019s hardening stance on immigration, including campaign advertisements in which she supports the idea of more Border Patrol agents.\n\nThis shift comes amid efforts by Republicans to hold Harris responsible for a surge in undocumented migrants into the US, by describing her as Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nNEW AD: On the border, the choice is simple. Kamala Harris is fighting to fix our broken immigration system. Donald Trump is trying to stop her. pic.twitter.com/t200w8iAYv \u2014 Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 30, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s her position on Medicare for All?\n\nWhen Harris was a senator for California, she signed on as a co-sponsor for Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All legislation which called for a single-payer health insurance system to provide everyone in the US with comprehensive healthcare.\n\nHowever, Harris\u2019s economic plan this time is silent on Medicare for All. So, it is unclear if she still backs the idea or has dropped it entirely.\n\nWill Harris ban fracking?\n\nDuring her 2019 primary run, Harris had also pledged to ban fracking \u2013 the controversial technique of extracting oil and gas from shale rock by drilling the earth.\n\nThe practice causes earth tremors and has a high environmental cost since the procedure consumes large amounts of water, in addition to releasing methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nHowever, Harris seems to have taken a U-turn on fracking during her presidential campaign this year. In late July, her campaign officials confirmed that she will not seek to ban fracking if elected.\n\nTrump had invoked her 2019 anti-fracking stance to criticise her.\n\nThe Biden administration allowed fracking. Harris herself has not made a public statement about whether or not she will ban fracking if she rises to the top job."

A group that supports Kamala Harris for president says Mr Kennedy's alleged removal and transportation of the skull of the whale may have broken the law. Mr Kennedy, 70, has not commented on the incident, detailed by his daughter in an interview 12 years ago. The call for an investigation comes days after he suspended his independent presidential campaign, which was marked by strange twists including his confession that he once dumped the body of a dead bear in New York's Central Park.\n\nMr Kennedy has now endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, and has been offered a place on the Republican candidate's transition team if he is elected. The incident with the whale's head, which dates to around 1994, was recounted by Kathleen \"Kick\" Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country magazine. Mr Kennedy, who is said to enjoy studying animal skulls and skeletons, reportedly heard that the dead animal had washed up in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where the family was staying. He went to the beach to cut off the head with a chainsaw, and then proceeded to tie it to the roof of the family minivan with bungee cords. The family then drove back to their home in New York, Ms Kennedy said. \"Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,\" Ms Kennedy told the magazine. \"We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.\" RFK Jr just endorsed Trump. Will it matter in November?\n\nAnalysis: Dead bear another strange twist in RFK Jr's campaign The call for an investigation was made by the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, which has publicly endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for president. The group wrote a letter to set out their case to marine protection officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The letter, quoted by US media, said Mr Kennedy may have broken multiple federal laws by collecting wildlife body parts and transporting them across state lines. \u201cVital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists,\" the group's political director Brett Hartl wrote. \"This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study,\u201d Mr Hartl added. Noaa confirmed to the BBC that it received the letter and was compiling a response. Mr Kennedy has not confirmed receipt of the letter. The BBC has approached his campaign for comment.\n\nUS election: RFK Jr drops presidential campaign and supports Donald Trump\n\nAt one point earlier this year, Mr Kennedy averaged about 15% in presidential preference polls as an independent candidate. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions, environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. But his numbers dwindled, and he announced last week he was suspending his campaign. Although he initially competed to win the Democratic nomination, he ended up criticising his former party and offering his endorsement to Donald Trump. The move dismayed his relatives, who are the most famous family in Democratic politics. Mr Kennedy's campaign attracted a range of bizarre and scandalous headlines. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. \u201cI have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,\u201d he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of \u201cgarbage\u201d but conceded that he had a \u201cvery, very rambunctious youth\u201d and that he was \u201cnot a church boy\u201d. Earlier this month, Mr Kennedy was filmed talking to actress Roseanne Barr, recounting the 2014 incident with the dead bear cub. He said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving in a rural area, and he put it in his van with the initial intention of harvesting its meat. But ultimately he thought it would be \"amusing\" to leave the carcass in New York's Central Park, to make it appear that an errant cyclist had killed the animal. The bear was found the following day. Responding to a BBC request for comment, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation said charges could not be brought for incidents more than a year old."

No economist on earth will support it, strategist says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the U.S., and implementing his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports would make inflation surge, according to a Nobel-prize winning economist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Trump were actually able to get his agenda through, it would be a disaster,\u201d Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Bill Clinton, told Quartz in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStiglitz, who more recently was head of the International Economic Association, said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201chas been a very steady hand with a set of well-talked-through proposals from the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrump every other day changes his mind about something,\u201d Stiglitz said, arguing that Trump\u2019s planned 50% tariffs on Chinese goods would slam lower- and middle-income Americans. \u201cThose tariffs would create a significant increase in the cost of living, it would be a shock to the economy, and that inflation, in turn, would lead the Fed to raise interest rates.\u201d\n\nReducing America\u2019s dependence on China can\u2019t be done with a sledgehammer, Stiglitz said. \u201cThe Biden-Harris proposal for a 10% tariff is an important signal to the market: \u2018You\u2019d better think about diversifying your supply chain.\u2019 And that, I would call good economic management. Good economic policy is balancing multiple concerns, and that kind of balancing is what distinguishes Harris from Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the specifics of Harris\u2019 plans, from boosting the child tax credit to planning to build three million new homes, Stiglitz said \u201cthe bundle as a whole is moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThose are cumulative problems that have been unattended for 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand so you\u2019re not going to be able to solve them overnight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 plans would also address the growth of monopolies, which have been holding back U.S. innovation and driving prices higher, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the weaknesses in the U.S. economy over the past 20 years has been a significant growth in market power, and that increase in market power reduces innovation, increases inequality, and lowers real wages of ordinary Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been one aspect of [the Biden-Harris] economic policy that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Trump and Harris lies in their tax policies.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 [Trump tax cut] was an enormous tax cut for the millionaires, and actually a tax increase when it was fully implemented for a large fraction of Americans,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWhat we need to do is restore tax justice, increase the taxes on the billionaires who can obviously afford it, and help address some of the big problems of inequality that we have, like child poverty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s move to cut the corporate income tax from 28% to to 21% did nothing to improve U.S. competitiveness, it just increased stock buybacks, Stiglitz said.\n\n\u201cExtending [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and making them deeper would make a huge hole in the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, the reason why they expired in 2025 was because the deficit created by the tax bill was so large that even Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe irony of his policies is that while a lot of support for them may come from people who feel like the system has left them behind,\u201d Siglitz added, \u201chis proposal will leave them even more behind.\u201d"

Auf Truth Social Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet bezeichnete Trump Harris\u2018 Antworten als \u201ezusammenhangloses Gerede\u201c, als sie von CNN-Moderatorin Dana Bash auf ihre fr\u00fcheren politischen Kehrtwendungen angesprochen wurde.\n\nAnzeige\n\nHarris\u2018 Erkl\u00e4rung, dass sich ihre \u201eWerte nicht ge\u00e4ndert haben\u201c, nahm Trump aufs Korn: \u201eDem stimme ich zu, ihre Werte haben sich nicht ge\u00e4ndert.\u201c Und f\u00fchrt fort: \u201eDie Grenze wird offen bleiben, es wird eine kostenlose Gesundheitsversorgung f\u00fcr illegale Einwanderer geben, ein Verbot von benzinbetriebenen Autos, die private Gesundheitsversorgung wird abgeschafft.\u201c Er warnte weiter, dass unter einer Pr\u00e4sidentschaft von Harris Amerika zu einem Brachland (\u201eWasteland\u201c) werden w\u00fcrde. 04:16 Uhr \u2013 Harris: Werde Fracking nicht verbieten \u201eAls Pr\u00e4sidentin werde ich Fracking nicht verbieten\u201c, sagte Kamala Harris in einem am Donnerstagabend (Ortszeit) ausgestrahlten Interview des Nachrichtensenders CNN.\n\nAnzeige\n\nIm Wahlkampf 2020 hatte die Vizepr\u00e4sidentin der USA noch gesagt, dass sie die umstrittene Praktik zur F\u00f6rderung von \u00d6l und Erdgas verbieten wolle.

Kennedy bei der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl am 5. November im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat North Carolina auf den Stimmzetteln stehen. Die dortige Wahlaufsicht lehnte am Donnerstag einen Antrag seiner Partei We The People ab, Kennedys Namen von den Stimmzetteln zu streichen.

US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin habe einem entsprechenden Hilfeersuchen des Heimatschutzministeriums zugestimmt, teilte Pentagon-Sprecherin Sabrina Singh mit. Austin habe den Befehlshaber des n\u00f6rdlichen US-Kommandos angewiesen, die Unterst\u00fctzung des f\u00fcr den Schutz der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten und ihre Stellvertreter zust\u00e4ndigen Secret Service zu verst\u00e4rken. Dies gelte auch f\u00fcr den gew\u00e4hlten Pr\u00e4sidenten und seinen Stellvertreter nach der Wahl am 5.

Die Buhrufe im Publikum ert\u00f6nten gleich zu Beginn des Auftritts des Senatos, andere Zuschauer applaudierten allerdings auch. \u201eKlingt so, als h\u00e4tten wir einige Fans und einige Hasser\u201c, sagte der 40-J\u00e4hrige bei der Konferenz in der Ostk\u00fcsten-Metropole Boston. \u201eDas ist in Ordnung. H\u00f6ren Sie sich an, was ich zu sagen habe, und ich werde meinen Standpunkt darlegen\u201c, so Vance weiter. 15:21 Uhr \u2013 Plattenfirma verbietet Trump, Abba-Songs auf Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu spielen\n\n\u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre Karrieren ausgewirkt haben\u201c, sagt Trump \u00fcber Clinton und Harris Die US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin der Demokraten, Kamala Harris, gibt zusammen mit Vizekandidat Tim Walz ihr erstes TV-Interview. Unterdessen geht Donald Trump einmal mehr unter die G\u00fcrtellinie. Erik Kirschbaum fasst die Ereignisse zusammen.\n\nDie Plattenfirma von ABBA fordert den US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Donald Trump auf, die zahlreichen Hits der schwedischen Kultband nicht mehr bei seinen Wahlkampfveranstaltungen zu verwenden. Universal Music in Schweden teilte der Nachrichtenagentur AFP in einer E-Mail mit, auf Videos sei zu sehen, dass die Musik von ABBA bei mindestens einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung des Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten gespielt worden sei. \u201eWir haben verlangt, dass es heruntergenommen und entfernt wird\u201c, hie\u00df es \u00fcber das Material. Die Plattenfirma hob hervor, dass sie nicht um Erlaubnis f\u00fcr die Nutzung der ABBA-Songs gebeten worden sei.

Sie f\u00fchrt laut der am Donnerstag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Umfrage mit einer Zustimmung von 45 Prozent vor Trump mit 41 Prozent. Die Erhebung wurde in den vergangenen acht Tagen bis Mittwoch vorgenommen. In einer Umfrage von Reuters/Ipsos von Ende Juli hatte Harris bei registrierten W\u00e4hlern mit nur einem Prozentpunkt vor Trump gelegen. Die neue Umfrage hat eine Fehlerquote von zwei Prozent.

Damit legte sie im Vergleich zur letzten Erhebung im Juli bei beiden Gruppen weiter zu. Trump lag dagegen bei wei\u00dfen W\u00e4hlern und M\u00e4nnern unver\u00e4ndert vorn. Es sei offensichtlich, dass das Rennen gegen Harris f\u00fcr Trump eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung sei als der Wahlkampf gegen Biden, sagte der republikanische Wahlkampf-Experte Matt Wolking. Doch sei Harris f\u00fcr Trump \u201enicht un\u00fcberwindlich\u201c. Trump m\u00fcsse vor allem darauf achten, W\u00e4hler nun nicht zu verschrecken, die in der Vergangenheit zu ihm tendierten, weil sie Biden ablehnten. 14:00 Uhr \u2013 Pressesprecher von J.D. Vance soll Verbindungen zu Rechtsextremen haben Parker Magid, der neue Pressesprecher des republikanischen Vizekandidaten J.D. Vance, hat f\u00fcr eine Beraterfirma gearbeitet, die tief verflochten mit neurechten und rechtsextremen Think-Tanks sein soll. Das berichtet der \u201eGuadrian\u201c Link wird in einem neuen Tab ge\u00f6ffnet . So soll die Beraterfirma Beck & Stone fundamentale Christen unterst\u00fctzen und der \u201eSociety for American Civic Renewal\u201c nahestehen, einer Geheimloge der Far-Right-Bewegung. Einer Extremismusforscherin zufolge, die der \u201eGuardian\u201c zitiert, handelt es sich bei den mit der Beraterfirma verwobenen Organisationen um solche, die in ihren Ansichten \u00fcber den konventionellen Konservatismus weit hinausgehen. 10:23 Uhr \u2013 Fotos von deutscher Influencerin von Pro-Trump-Accounts benutzt Pro-Trump-Accounts im Online-Dienst X bedienen sich bei Social-Media-Fotos von 17 europ\u00e4ischen Frauen. Das berichtet der US-Sender CNN. Auch mindestens eine Deutsche sei betroffen. Dies habe eine Untersuchung in Kooperation mit dem Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) ergeben. Die benutzten Fotos seien auf X-Profilen ausgespielt worden, die offenbar Teil einer koordinierten Kampagne waren, welche das Trump-Vance-Lager vor den Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen unterst\u00fctzen sollte. Laut CNN-Bericht zeigt eine Analyse dutzender Pro-Trump-Konten ein systematisches Muster von \u201enicht authentischem Verhalten\u201c. Alle Konten w\u00fcrden gestohlene oder manipulierte Fotos von jungen Frauen zeigen, die ihre Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Trump in Posts erkl\u00e4rten und Hashtags wie #MAGAPatriots oder #MAGA2024 verwendeten. Die Bilder seien oftmals manipuliert worden, um auf der Kleidung Trump-Slogans zu platzieren. Es gebe keinen Hinweis darauf, dass Trump und sein Team involviert waren.\n\nLesen Sie auch Weltplus Artikel US-Wahl 2024 Dumm vs. d\u00fcmmer \u2013 Harris und Trump \u00fcberbieten sich mit \u00f6konomischer Ahnungslosigkeit\n\nEiner der Fake-Accounts, der im CNN-Artikel genannt wird, hei\u00dft @Luna_2K24.

Trump teilte auf der von ihm mit begr\u00fcndeten Plattform Truth Social den Beitrag eines anderen Nutzers, der andeutete, dass sexuelle Gef\u00e4lligkeiten Harris\u2018 politische Karriere bef\u00f6rdert haben k\u00f6nnten. In dem Post ist ein \u00e4lteres Bild von Kamala Harris zu sehen an der Seite der fr\u00fcheren US-Au\u00dfenministerin und Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Hillary Clinton, die 2016 im Wahlkampf gegen Trump angetreten war. Dazu der Kommentar: \u201eLustig, wie sich Blowjobs auf ihre beiden Karrieren unterschiedlich ausgewirkt haben...\u201c\n\nDie derbe Bemerkung ist eine Anspielung auf einen Sex-Skandal, in den Clintons Mann Bill w\u00e4hrend dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft (1993 \u2013 2001) verwickelt gewesen war. Trump-Unterst\u00fctzer wiederum verbreiten v\u00f6llig unbelegte Behauptungen \u00fcber Harris, wonach die romantische Beziehung zu einem einflussreichen Politiker in Kalifornien in den 90er Jahren ihrer Karriere geholfen habe. 00:11 Uhr \u2013 Trump-Team \u00e4u\u00dfert sich zu Vorfall auf Soldatenfriedhof Donald Trump hatte am Montag auf dem Friedhof nahe der US-Hauptstadt Washington bei einer Kranzniederlegung der vor drei Jahren bei einem Selbstmordanschlag in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten US-Soldaten gedacht. Auch einige Familienmitglieder der Opfer waren anwesend. Nun wurde bekannt, dass es bei der Visite zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen Trumps Team und Mitarbeitern des Friedhofs kam. Kritiker warfen dem republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Trump vor, er habe seinen Besuch f\u00fcr Wahlkampfzwecke missbraucht. Seine Kampagne wies das zur\u00fcck. Die US-Rundfunkorganisation NPR berichtete, zwei Trump-Mitarbeiter h\u00e4tten bei dem Besuch einen Mitarbeiter des Friedhofs beschimpft und zur Seite geschubst, als dieser Film- und Fotoaufnahmen auf einem bestimmten Teil des Gel\u00e4ndes habe unterbinden wollen. Ein Trump-Sprecher schreibt nun auf der Plattform X, ein Fotograf sei zugelassen gewesen. In einer Stellungnahme f\u00fcr NPR erkl\u00e4rte dieser weiter, der Friedhofsmitarbeiter habe wohl \u201ean einer psychischen St\u00f6rung\u201c gelitten und sich Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams physisch in den Weg gestellt.\n\nTrumps Wahlkampfteam ver\u00f6ffentlichte auf X au\u00dferdem eine Stellungnahme von Angeh\u00f6rigen der in Afghanistan get\u00f6teten Soldaten, die dem Republikaner f\u00fcr seinen Besuch dankten. Sie h\u00e4tten der Teilnahme eines Fotografen zugestimmt, und das Verhalten von Trump und dessen Team sei von gr\u00f6\u00dftem Respekt gepr\u00e4gt gewesen. Mittwoch, 28.

            "text": "The official J.D. Vance Bad Press Tour keeps on rolling this week, as the Republican vice presidential hopeful faces scrutiny over 2021 comments he made bashing teachers without biological children, including American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten.\n\nAlready grappling with widespread backlash over another 2021 jab calling Democratic politicians and voters \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d Vance now must answer more questions about further comments he made during an October 2021 political event for the Center for Christian Virtue. \u201cSo many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they\u2019re people without kids trying to brainwash the minds of our children. That really disorients me and disturbs me,\u201d Vance said during the event. \u201cRandi Weingarten, who\u2019s the head of the most powerful teachers\u2019 union in the country, she doesn\u2019t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\u201d\n\nWeingarten is a lesbian, and introduced the public to her wife, Liz Margolies, in 2007. Vance\u2019s disparaging remarks, however, were also inaccurate: Weingarten, believed to be the first openly LGBTQ+ president of a major U.S. labor union, is stepmother to Margolies\u2019 biological children, and described herself as a \u201cmother by marriage\u201d last year when subjected to similar attacks on her motherhood by Vance\u2019s GOP colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nStill, Vance doubled down on, and falsely reframed, his own remarks while being interviewed on the tarmac outside the Trump-Vance campaign jet this week, as CNN reported. \u201cI didn\u2019t criticize Randi Weingarten for not having kids, I criticized her for wanting to brainwash mine,\u201d Vance claimed. Meanwhile, Weingarten responded in an MSNBC interview, calling his comments \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d\n\nA Viral Image Appears to Show Virulently Anti-LGBTQ+ VP Candidate J.D. Vance in Drag Content creator and podcast host Matt Bernstein posted the image to X and Instagram over the weekend.\n\nVance has not specifically stated in what way he believes Weingarten is \u201cbrainwashing\u201d his children. His statement at the Center for Christian Virtue event was made in the general context of \u201cthe ideology of the left,\u201d which Vance characterized as \u201ccontrol[ling] what our children learn.\u201d Similarly vague, yet apocalyptic, rhetoric about Weingarten and the AFT has proliferated on the right over the last several years. In a 2022 interview, former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Weingarten \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d and alleged that teachers\u2019 unions are \u201cthe most likely to take this republic down.\u201d Other Republican lines of attack have included the accusation that Weingarten and the AFT puppeteered the U.S.\u2019 COVID-19 policy, which Weingarten flatly denied and called \u201cwild allegations.\u201d"

            "headline": "Kamala\u2019s Moment",
            "text": "The Precise Time Department sounds like something from a story by Jorge Luis Borges, but it is a real subdivision of the US Navy. At the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris has her official residence, the department maintains the Master Clock with which all others in the military system are harmonized. At the end of the driveway that leads from the vice-president\u2019s house, there is a public display of these exact hours, minutes, and seconds set beside a huge ship\u2019s anchor, as though this superaccurate chronometer served to hold America steady and prevent it from coming unmoored. Such reassurance seems, of course, ever more illusory.\n\nThere is a melancholy evocation of the Master Clock and its merciless motions at the start of Promise Me, Dad (2017), Joe Biden\u2019s account of his public and private lives in 2014. Biden was then living at the Naval Observatory as vice-president to Barack Obama. Leaving the residence for his family\u2019s annual Thanksgiving gathering in Nantucket, he seemed momentarily mesmerized:\n\nI glanced at the squat, standing digital clock at the top of the driveway, as I had maybe a thousand times since we had moved into the official residence. Red numbers glowed, ticking away in metronomic perfection: 5:11:42, 5:11:43, 5:11:44, 5:11:45\u2026. Precise Time\u2014synchronized to the millisecond\u2014had been deemed an operational imperative by the Department of Defense, which had troops and bases in locations around the globe. 5:11:50, 5:11:51, 5:11:52.\n\nOur limousine was already accelerating out of the turn with an abrupt force that pushed me back into the soft leather seats. The clock was behind us in a flash, out of sight, but still marking the time as it melted away\u20145:11:58, 5:11:59, 5:12:00.\n\nFor Biden, time was melting away. He did not get to be his party\u2019s nominee for president in 2016, and that in turn meant that he would be too old to stand for a second term in 2024. Hard as he tried, he could not, in the end, escape the clock\u2019s relentless indifference to his desire to stay in power. But for Harris, the glowing red numbers that haunted Biden may mark the precise time. They have hurried her to a moment not just of personal destiny but of historic fate.\n\nHarris\u2019s rapid coronation as the Democratic candidate for the presidency is at once quite fortuitous and utterly timely. It might be called an accident that\u2019s been waiting to happen. An accident because were it not for a series of unprecedented events\u2014Biden\u2019s becoming the oldest president in US history, his disintegration in a live televised debate, Donald Trump\u2019s political resurgence after an attempted coup and personal resurrection after an attempted assassination\u2014neither she nor any other Black woman would have become the candidate of either of the two main parties. The time, in conventional wisdom, would not have been right. The voters would not have been ready. The clock would have to tick on through endless cycles before the day arrived when it would feel safe to have, at the top of the ticket, an embodiment of American power that was neither white nor male.\n\nAnd yet it was an accident waiting to happen because this conventional wisdom is itself out of sync with a nation in which white men make up just 30 percent of the population. This is the minority that benefits from a spectacular application of positive discrimination in the political sphere: it accounts for close to two thirds of officeholders. By contrast, only three Black women\u2014Shirley Chisholm in 1972, Carol Moseley Braun in 2004, and Harris in 2020\u2014have previously even sought a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and only three (including Harris) have served in the Senate. No Black woman has been elected as a governor, and only twenty-five have held other senior statewide offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, or secretary of state.\n\nTime shapes contemporary American politics in two additional ways\u2014anachronism and gerontocracy. Biden, because of who he is, seemed to embody both the superannuated nature of America\u2019s political class and its overrepresentation of white men of the baby boomer generation. Harris, because of who she is, is uniquely placed to call time on both these realities\u2014which means, first of all, calling time on Donald Trump. If she frames her campaign effectively, Harris can make Trump a throwback and herself the embodiment of a future that has already taken shape in American demography.\n\nThat campaign can and must be about the things that affect people\u2019s daily lives\u2014jobs, health care, education, the climate crisis. But ticking away underneath it is another kind of question: Who is a normal American now? Harris\u2019s choice of running mate suggests she is aware of this: the avuncular Minnesota governor Tim Walz has a gift for making progressive ideals seem familiar, ordinary, and rooted in down-home common sense. Meanwhile, Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, implicitly appeal to a more symbolic notion of representation: however complex and diverse American society might seem to be, its essential form is male, white, and at least culturally Christian. This has always been so in the past and must always be so in the future. If demography, and therefore democracy, is flowing away from this eternal truth, then democracy must be frozen in time. When Trump told a right-wing Christian audience on July 26 that if they vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d they \u201cwon\u2019t have to do it anymore,\u201d he was putting forward his own notion of the end of history. The changes that are making the US more ethnically diverse, less comfortably patriarchal, and less Christian will be permanently checked because the institutions of power will have been made safe from their effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the problem with Biden\u2019s candidacy was that, for vastly more benign reasons, it drew on a parallel idea of holding back a tide of change. Biden presented himself, not without reason, as a bulwark, the only immovable object that could stop the apparently unstoppable Trump. As the Democratic candidate, Harris has rightly taken up Biden\u2019s message that the election in November is, as the outgoing president put it in his address from the Oval Office on July 24, about \u201csaving our democracy.\u201d But her candidacy carries a much stronger resonance. It says that saving American democracy is not at all the same thing as preserving it.\n\nBiden used the metaphor made famous by John F. Kennedy when he became, at forty-three, the second-youngest president in US history: \u201cI\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\u201d But the torch of American democracy must be envisaged as a flickering flame. In her rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, Hillary Clinton spoke of how \u201cevery generation has carried the torch forward.\u201d It is not a secure and fixed inheritance that can be handed down as a bequest from one generation to the next. It is a dangerous and endangered idea that must always draw fuel from new sources. American democracy cannot be saved if it is not reimagined, deepened, expanded, and brought into line with contemporary American realities. It is open to Harris to embody the energy of that urgent updating. Indeed, she can scarcely do otherwise.\n\nIt would be good to live in a world where Harris\u2019s gender and ethnicity were irrelevant and where she was judged solely on her record and ideas. But if there is any such world, it does not include the US. Trump, Vance, and the Republican Party will not permit such a possibility. Their reactionary mindset is obsessed with human biology\u2014Harris, for them, is inescapably defined by her chromosomes. The idea of the reproduction of America through the generations is projected onto her body. So far as we know, none of the forty-five occupants to date of the Oval Office has given birth to a child\u2014but in Harris\u2019s case this nonevent is a neglect of biological duty that makes her, in Vance\u2019s words, one of the \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d who don\u2019t \u201chave a direct stake\u201d in the country\u2019s future. The point of this contention is precisely that it is a claim on the future. Tomorrow belongs to Vance and those who look and think like him.\n\nHarris does, of course, have children through her marriage to Doug Emhoff, but because she did not give birth to them, Vance cited her first among the ranks of \u201cpeople without children.\u201d This, crucially, excludes her from the norm and indeed makes her the prime example of those who \u201chate normal Americans for choosing family.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that Harris has failed to give birth; it is also that she has failed to be properly born. John Eastman, a coconspirator in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 election, sought the Republican nomination for California attorney general in 2010, the year Harris won that office. In August 2020 Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman protesting that \u201cbefore we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris\u2019 eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth.\u201d He claimed (on spurious constitutional grounds) that since (as he thought) Harris\u2019s parents were in the United States on temporary visas when she was born in October 1964, she\n\nowed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers\u2014Jamaica, in the case of her father, and India, in the case of her mother\u2014and was therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment as originally understood.\n\nAt the time Trump amplified this bogus allegation, describing Eastman as a \u201cvery highly qualified, very talented lawyer\u201d and remarking that\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI heard it today that she doesn\u2019t meet the requirements\u2026. I have no idea if that\u2019s right, I would\u2019ve\u2014I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026very serious.\n\nOn August 19, as the Democratic convention was opening, Trump returned to this theme, asking of the Democrats: \u201cI wonder if they knew where she comes from.\u201d In this upending of the idea of birthright, Harris has no right to be American because she was born wrong. If there\u2019s a genre underpinning the Republican disdain for Harris, it\u2019s a nativity play that has become a horror movie. In Eastman\u2019s narrative, she was already, at the very moment of her birth, a traitor to America, loyal to two foreign powers. According to Vance\u2019s rhetoric, this misbegotten woman has grown up to be the potential begetter of a sterile American future.\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been attacked with both these biological weapons. Barack Obama had to face down Trump\u2019s birther lies but not the other natalist assault as well. No one said he hated ordinary Americans because he had not brought his own pregnancy to term. Yet it is the very unprecedented nature of this double assault on her bodily being that also gives Harris an exceptional power. She knows how to deal with this stuff\u2014she has been doing so all her life, with considerable grace.\n\nIt seems telling that Trump has had to abandon his mocking nickname for her, Laffin\u2019 Kamala, presumably because of a belated realization that her laughter\u2014so different from his own cruel comedy\u2014seems to most people to express optimism, youthfulness, and a joy in life, all qualities that he (as well as Biden) so patently lacks. She politicizes the idea of being comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. And in that comfort, there is a paradoxical kind of potency. She can be extremely radical by presenting herself merely as what she is. For if Harris really is a \u201cnormal American\u201d (as of course she is), it can only be because the American norm has been transformed. It can be possible because the torch has already been passed not just to a new generation but to new forms of personal and collective self-definition.\n\nHarris is fluent in a kind of baby talk very different from the demented babble of the Republican assaults on her. She does not run from the politicization of her body\u2014she embraces it. She is, in the way she tells her own story, a child of struggle. In her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey (2019), the earliest memory she recounts is of \u201ca sea of legs moving about, of the energy and shouts and chants.\u201d She gives us an infant\u2019s-eye view of political activism, with her looking up from her stroller at the legs of fellow civil rights marchers. Her cutest baby anecdote is freighted with time and history: \u201cMy mother would laugh telling a story she loved about the time when I was fussing as a toddler. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 she asked, trying to soothe me. \u2018Fweedom!\u2019 I yelled back.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the only good moment in her primary campaign of 2019, Harris identified herself explicitly and indignantly as a Black child of the 1960s. She attacked Biden for his opposition to the policy of integrating school systems by busing pupils from Black families to white-dominated areas: \u201cYou know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Her campaign tweeted a picture of Harris as a little girl, her hair in pigtails tied with bows. It then produced T-shirts printed with this image and the words \u201c THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME .\u201d Childhood yarns are part of the grammar of American politics, but this one is different. It is more defiant than endearing, more confrontational than sentimental.\n\nThe image of a Black girl in pigtails has its own specific history. In 1954, just months after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found educational segregation to be unconstitutional, Scientific American published an article titled \u201cThe Biology of the Negro.\u201d It was written by Curt Stern, an influential geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley\u2014the same university to which Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had traveled from India to study nutrition and endocrinology. It followed a lecture Stern had delivered in 1946 under the title \u201cWhy Do People Differ?\u201d According to the historian of medicine Michael Yudell:\n\nThe program for the lecture pictured a cartoon with three girls, two of whom were white, one black. The local chapter of the NAACP objected to the picture of a shabbily dressed black girl in pigtails wearing boots flanked by two well-dressed white girls looking at the black girl and smiling.\n\nBut in 1964, just months before Harris was born, Look magazine published what became a famous painting by Norman Rockwell called The Problem We All Live With. It shows another little Black girl in pigtails, this time neatly dressed in all-white clothes that emphasize the color of her skin. She is six-year-old Ruby Bridges, walking determinedly to her first day at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans in 1960. Towering over her, so high that their faces are out of the frame, are four men identified by their yellow armbands as deputy US marshals. Behind Bridges is a wall splattered with the bloodred juice of a hurled tomato and graffitied in bold letters with the N-word. By inviting his viewers to see this painting as a reality \u201cwe all\u201d live with, Rockwell was saying this violence is every bit as American as his supposedly nostalgic images of a vanishing small-town way of life.\n\nWhen Harris produced her THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME T-shirts, she was invoking her own history as well as the image of Ruby Bridges. And what\u2019s striking about this is that \u201ca Norman Rockwell view of America\u201d is proverbial shorthand for a sanitized and sentimentalized version of the past. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear (2018), Trump\u2019s economic adviser Gary Cohn made this very accusation against the then president in a heated argument over the nature of contemporary America: \u201c\u2018Mr. President,\u2019 Cohn said, trying to summarize, \u2018You have a Norman Rockwell view of America.\u2019\u201d Harris, to the contrary, evokes a very different \u201cNorman Rockwell view of America,\u201d one in which racial violence and resistance are acknowledged as part of a shared reality.\n\nThe creation of \u201cthat little girl\u201d involved the making of a profound choice about American history\u2014and about its most toxic aspect: slavery. Of all the \u201cfirsts\u201d that Harris represents\u2014first female vice-president, first Black woman and first Indian American to contest the presidency\u2014the one that goes unspoken is that if she wins in November, she will be the first openly acknowledged descendant of slaves to lead America. In this identification there is a complex interplay between freedom and necessity. It can perhaps best be appreciated through the uncanny recurrence of the same Irish name in her genealogy and in Biden\u2019s: Finnegan or Finegan. It is Biden\u2019s mother\u2019s surname and a constant point of reference in his idea of who he really is. It lives on in the name of his granddaughter Finnegan. It is also the name of Harris\u2019s father\u2019s maternal grandmother, Miss Iris, a Black woman born, as he recalled in a 2020 essay, \u201cIris Finegan.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s parents split up when she was five, and her father subsequently had a limited place in her life. Donald Harris, a leftist critic of orthodox theories of underdevelopment, became the first Black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford\u2019s economics department. He wrote of Kamala and her sister, Maya, that \u201cmy one big regret is that they did not come to know very well the two most influential women in my life,\u201d Miss Iris and his other grandmother, Miss Chrishy. Donald reproduced with his essay a photograph of Miss Iris with a two-year-old Kamala on her knee. He recalled how\n\nwe drove up to Thatch Walk and worked our way, with lots of cuts and bruises, through the same cane fields where Miss Iris had run a thriving business in the \u201cgood ole days\u201d of sugar and, a long time before, had probably been part of a slave plantation.\n\nThis locates a potential American president in the fields where some of her ancestors were enslaved to the brutal task of cutting cane.\n\nIn this other history, a name like Finegan loses the meaning it has for Biden: a sense of continuity, an uncomplicated connection to a genetic heritage. These Irish ancestors cannot be assumed to be what they are to Biden\u2014heroic underdogs. Miss Chrishy was born Christiana Brown, and Donald Harris believes her to be a \u201cdescendant of Hamilton Brown.\u201d Hamilton Brown, who owned a large number of slaves in Jamaica and fiercely opposed abolition, was also Irish, born in County Antrim. But unlike John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Biden, and even Barack Obama, all of whom engaged in the public ritual of visiting Ireland to celebrate their ancestral roots, Harris would probably not want to celebrate her distant Finegan and Brown cousins.\n\nThis is because Blackness is seldom a free choice. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists at the end of July, Trump claimed that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d and had previously been identifying only with her Indian heritage. \u201cIs she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one but she obviously doesn\u2019t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she became a Black person.\u201d This was a lie\u2014Harris has always identified as Black. But it also revealed a certain kind of truth about one of the ways racism operates: Trump\u2019s attack on Harris was based on the assumption that she must be either Black or not Black.\n\nIt is easy for white Americans to pick an ethnicity\u2014Biden could have decided to identify with his French or English, rather than his Irish, heritage. It is easy for white Americans to tell little lies about their ancestry. Trump himself has more than once falsely claimed that his father, Fred, who was born in New York, was in fact born in Germany: \u201cMy father is German, was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany, so I have a very great feeling for Germany.\u201d Fred Trump himself claimed for some years that he was Swedish. Harris, on the other hand, could not cherry-pick from among her complex origins. Her mother was indeed born in India and lived there until she was nineteen. Yet Gopalan understood that her girls were not going to be perceived in America as Brahmins. As Harris puts it in The Truths We Hold:\n\nMy mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.\n\nThis is not a relishing of the openness of identity in America. It is something much more serious: an attempt to find the freedom within inevitability. Gopalan understood that her daughters could not escape the identity that a racist society would impose on them, including the history of enslavement that is part of their ancestry. What they could do is find the pride within that identity and embody the resistance that is the other side of that history.\n\nThey had to do this in an atmosphere of ferocious political engagement, in which these same questions of freedom and necessity were being hammered out within Black radicalism. Trump seeks to define Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d and there is no doubt that Republicans will delve into her parents\u2019 political stances in the 1960s to find evidence for this characterization. But it is the exact opposite of the truth. The radical left is a huge influence on Harris\u2014in the sense that she is part of a generational reaction against the revolutionary Black politics of the 1960s. She is a child of the revolution only in the sense that she grew up in its wreckage.\n\nThere is a figure in The Truths We Hold who is both named and not named, both intimately embraced and held at a distance. He is introduced as follows: Harris writes that San Francisco State University \u201chad a student-run Experimental College, and in 1966, another of my mother\u2019s dear friends, whom I knew as Uncle Aubrey, taught the college\u2019s first-ever class in black studies.\u201d We later learn that Aubrey\u2019s aunt, Regina Shelton, was a \u201csecond mother\u201d to Kamala and that \u201cwe shared a long-standing relationship of love, care, and connection\u201d to this extended family. Uncle Aubrey is not given his full name, Aubrey LaBrie. Nor does Harris say much about his politics.\n\nIn 2019 Harris told Molly Ball of Time that she remembered coming \u201cdown the stairs of her childhood house in Berkeley to see FREE BOBBY carved in wet cement, after the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was arrested.\u201d Her childhood world was that from which the Panthers emerged. In 1965 LaBrie, along with his brothers Huey and Abdul and other friends, founded a periodical called Black Dialogue. It was in part a cultural magazine, publishing stories, poems, and essays alongside graphic art by young Black painters. But it was also highly political, and Aubrey is listed as its \u201cpolitical editor,\u201d presumably responsible for its ideological direction. Its first issue appeared in the aftermath of the murder of Malcolm X and is \u201cproudly dedicated\u201d to his memory as a \u201cgreat leader and a greater MAN .\u201d\n\nIt was also produced immediately after the brutal police assault on peaceful civil rights marchers at Selma. It seethes with both the passion and the anguish of uncertainty that so many young Black activists felt in the face of such loss and violence. It despairs of the possibilities of looking to the two spheres that Kamala Harris would go on to inhabit\u2014the law and democratic politics\u2014to win justice:\n\nThe Black Americans are nauseated by the practices of the White community that are, to them, mockingly meaningless, hypocritical, dishonest and essentially amoral. These young Black people have no faith in the Constitution and no respect for the White man\u2019s law. Why should they? What has it done for them? The law is dispensed in a manner which makes it a great big atrocious lie. It is merely another weapon to use against them.\n\nAfter the Watts riots in Los Angeles in August 1965, when South Central LA became a combat zone and thirty-four people died, Black Dialogue published a call to arms by Aubrey LaBrie\u2019s younger brother Huey:\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters of Watts, how proud we are of you. You who burned the city of angels and shook the crumbling white power structure\u2026. The enemy called it a riot but we know that it was an insurrection. It was one battle in the \u201cwar of Armageddon\u201d or the war between the black and white. The blacks who participated in the insurrection introduced an extremely effective tactic of igniting fires to local parasitical white business communities. They were not rioters or hoodlums, they were guerrillas.\n\nThere is an irony here. The \u201cwar of Armageddon,\u201d as invoked in Black Dialogue, was almost certainly drawn from the preaching of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. But it now has no purchase on the American left or on mainstream Black politics. Where it does have a strong grip is on the dark imagination of Trumpism. The insurrectionist violence that Trump unleashed with the invasion of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was fed by the millenarian vision of a coming civil war, framed by many of its believers as a racial \u201cwar between the black and white.\u201d The Republican Party has moved into the orbit of apocalyptic tribalism. If you want to see a figure who represents the most definitive movement out of that orbit, look at Harris.\n\nHarris told Ball in 2019 that \u201cthe reality is that when you are the so-called minority you learn many languages, necessarily.\u201d She did not mean literal languages but rather the languages of power. Harris entered the very arenas her mother\u2019s friends and political allies had despaired of: the law, party politics, elective public office. She chose to believe what the previous generation could not\u2014that justice can be achieved by working from inside the existing institutional structures. It is an act of faith that critics of her work as a prosecutor and attorney general in California do not believe to be justified in practice by the way she used her power. She sought to uphold some wrongful convictions, threatened to prosecute parents of habitually truant children (a policy that disproportionately affected people of color), and even appealed a federal court ruling that California\u2019s death penalty is unconstitutional (in spite of her own complete repudiation of the death penalty). But her caution is not mere moderation or bland centrism. It comes from a complex personal and political navigation between the desire for freedom on the one side and the tight constraints of reality on the other.\n\nThat weighing of what is right against what is possible is the business of democracy, and Harris represents the way the left has accepted that difficult responsibility. American politics has ended up in a place where it is those on the right who want to burn everything down. They will do that, if they can, in the name of a phony American normality that excludes Harris and everyone who shares with her a complex identity. It is striking, therefore, that Harris\u2019s candidacy has given Democrats permission to point out how \u201cweird\u201d the Republicans\u2019 version of America really is. Walz put the word into circulation just days after Biden announced his departure from the national stage. In a punchy statement after Trump appeared on Fox News, the Harris campaign listed as one of the main takeaways: \u201cTrump is old and quite weird?\u201d The conjunction of these two qualities implies that what is truly strange is not just Trump\u2019s chronological age but the anachronistic vision in which only white men who plant their seed in fertile women are authentic citizens and legitimate rulers. Against that weirdness, we have the real possibility of a president whose history is synchronized with American reality.\n\n\u2014August 20, 2024"
