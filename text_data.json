Read preview\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will beat former President Donald Trump this November, says the historian who successfully predicted nine out of 10 presidential elections since 1984.\n\n\"Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States, at least that's my prediction for the outcome of this race,\" Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University, told The New York Times in a video interview that aired on Thursday.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nLichtman, whose \"Keys to the White House\" prediction model consists of 13 true-or-false questions, said in the interview that eight keys were in Harris' favor.\n\nTrump, Lichtman said, had three keys going for him \u2014 one, Harris isn't an incumbent; two, Harris isn't, in his opinion, a \"once-in-a-generational, broadly inspirational candidate\"; and three, the Democratic Party lost control of the House during the midterm elections in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that was outnumbered by eight other keys.\n\nBesides benefiting from the positive short- and long-term economic conditions as well as legislative accomplishments under President Joe Biden's administration, Harris' candidacy wasn't dogged by any scandals or ongoing social unrest, Lichtman said.\n\nIn addition, Harris did not have to go through a primary contest to succeed Biden as nominee, he added. Lichtman said that it helped that she was facing off against Trump, who \"only appeals to a narrow base.\"\n\nHarris, he said, also didn't have a third-party challenger since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last two keys \u2014 on foreign policy failures and successes \u2014 wouldn't matter as much since Trump would still only have five keys even if they were against Harris, Lichtman said.\n\nLichtman's assessment marks a slight shift from his last prediction in July when he told The Wall Street Journal that the Democratic Party should stick with Biden if they wanted to retain the White House.\n\n\"Biden running checks off two keys right. Biden steps aside, they lose obviously the incumbency, and it's not at all clear that there wouldn't be a big party fight,\" he said then.\n\nAlthough Biden did eventually drop out, Harris was able to avert a primary contest. Besides securing Biden's endorsement, Harris was able to get her party to unite around her in short order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, Lichtman's predictions haven't always been on the money. He got the 2000 election wrong when he predicted a victory for Al Gore instead of the eventual winner, George W. Bush.\n\nThat's been the only election outcome Lichtman got wrong since he started giving predictions in the 1984 election.\n\nRepresentatives for the Harris campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours."

            "headline": "Donald Trump Says Elon Musk Will Lead \u2018Government Efficiency\u2019 Task Force",
            "text": "Donald Trump has made it known that, if elected again, he will create a \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d commission to audit the federal government\u2014an idea that was notably spawned by his pal (and, more recently, funder and unofficial campaign administrator), billionaire jackass Elon Musk. Lord help us.\n\nTrump made the remarks Thursday during a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club. \u201cAt the suggestion of Elon Musk, who has given me his complete and total endorsement\u2026I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,\u201d Trump said. \u201cElon has agreed to head the task force,\u201d Trump added while noting that the task force would be responsible for \u201cmaking recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d to the government.\n\nMusk, who originally mentioned the commission during a podcast appearance last month, made it known that he would jump at the opportunity to take the job that he made up. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help out on such a commission,\u201d he said Thursday on X. \u201cI look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises. No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.\u201d Later, Musk tweeted: \u201cThis would unlock tremendous prosperity for America.\u201d\n\nThe Journal was quick to note that such a position could represent a conflict of interest. Given the fact that multiple Musk-owned companies are currently under investigation by federal agencies, what\u2019s to stop Elon from using his \u201cefficiency\u201d commission to argue that the SEC (which is currently probing his takeover of Twitter) is \u201cinefficient\u201d and needs gutting? Indeed, handing Musk such a role gives him the perfect bureaucratic vantage point to target his enemies in government. In the past, Musk has also raged against America\u2019s National Labor Relations Board, the agency tasked with protecting America\u2019s workers from people like Musk. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine that it could also be on the chopping block.\n\nIn general, Musk\u2019s commission sounds in line with the rest of Trump\u2019s plans for a second presidency, the likes of which would likely be a windfall for America\u2019s plutocrats and a complete disaster for everybody else.\n\nLike their rightwing backers, Trump and his cronies have made a lot of noise about the need for \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d and federal spendthrift. However, voters would do well to remember that, during his first administration, Trump was hardly the picture of \u201cefficiency.\u201d Indeed, he caused one of the single biggest increases in the national debt in our nation\u2019s history (the only apparent exceptions being George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln). Trump added to the debt substantially when he pointlessly gave huge tax breaks to America\u2019s richest people, like Musk. Notably, some estimates say Trump ran the national debt up twice as much as Biden. Furthermore, analysis of Trump\u2019s new economic plan shows it would add as much as $4 trillion to the national deficit over the course of the next decade\u2014substantially more than Kamala Harris\u2019 plan.\n\nPerhaps to distract from the fact that their economic designs are basically just an Oprah-style giveaway to America\u2019s plutocratic elite, Donald Trump and his allies (including Musk) have resorted to a rather pathetic attempt to cast Kamala Harris\u2014a wealthy former prosecutor who is married to a corporate lawyer\u2014as a \u201ccommunist.\u201d Trump has spewed a near-constant stream of vitriol at Harris, repeatedly referring to her as \u201cComrade Kamala\u201d and suggesting that the rather tame economic suggestions that her campaign has made in recent weeks would put America on the path to Bolshevism. The implication here seems clear: any attempt to use the government to lessen the impact of corporate predation on everyday people is \u201ccommunism,\u201d while the path to bureaucratic virtue is paved with privatization and tax giveaways to the rich."

Read preview\n\nDozens of prominent Wall Street and tech executives combined forces on Friday morning to support Kamala Harris' bid for the White House. Eighty-eight top executives signed a joint letter endorsing the vice president, CNBC reported.\n\nThe signatories span political engagement, from longtime Democratic donors to people issuing their first public endorsement of Harris. James Murdoch, the former CEO of 21st Century Fox, broke even further away from his father by adding his name to the list.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThough the list of signatories is lengthy, the letter itself is a mere five sentences. Electing Harris is, the executives wrote, \"the best way to support the continued strength, security, and reliability of our democracy and economy.\" They celebrated her record support of small businesses and said she would \"continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment.\"\n\nCurrent executives include Aaron Levie of Box and Jeremy Stoppelman of Yelp, as well as big names in the sports world. The NBA Hall of Famer and billionaire Magic Johnson signed on, so did Ted Leonsis, whose company owns the NBA's Washington Wizards and WNBA's Washington Mystics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome signatories, such as Murdoch and the Ripple Labs cofounder Chris Larsen, declared their support for Harris for the first time.\n\n\"Proud to support the Harris campaign \u2014 she's the right leader for our fast-changing world,\" Larsen told Business Insider in a statement. \"And I'm confident that she will reset the misguided Biden policies that were too anti-business and anti-innovation. At the same time, I'm confident she will maintain Biden's strong leadership on our energy transition.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nLarsen added that he recently donated $1 million in crypto to Future Forward, a PAC supporting Harris.\n\nOther signatories have long rallied behind the vice president. Many know her from her days in California politics, which reflects how Harris is relying on her home state for support, financial and otherwise. The veteran Harris supporters include the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs and the Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth coasts are well represented, with executives from Silicon Valley and Wall Street alike joining the effort. The angel investor Ron Conway, the entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and the LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman are among the biggest West Coast names, while former Blackstone President and CEO Tony James and the former Goldman Sachs executive Bruce Heyman hail from the world of New York finance.\n\nFormer executives at various prominent companies \u2014 including PepsiCo, Paramount, Lyft, and Starbucks \u2014 also signed on to endorse Harris.\n\nThe support from the business community comes at a crucial time, as both Harris and Trump are laying out their economic agendas ahead of Tuesday's debate. Both candidates are presenting themselves as the pro-business option while attempting to woo the financial and tech sectors.\n\nCorrection: September 6, 2024 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misdescribed Harris. She is the current US vice president, not a former vice president."

I'm Leah Feiger, the senior politics editor at WIRED. A few months ago, a lot of people were concerned about how artificial intelligence might affect the 2024 US election. AI-generated images, audio, and video had just gotten so good and was so easy to make and spread. The WIRED politics team in our project tracking the use of AI in elections around the world actually called 2024 the year of the generative AI election. Lately, it seems like some of the panic around AI has subsided, but deepfakes of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and other politicians and their supporters are everywhere. And as we'll talk about today, legislation on political deepfakes, including AI-generated pornography, is really tricky. So with the election looming, what has changed, if anything, and how much should we really be worrying about AI? Joining me to talk about all of this are two of WIRED's AI experts. We have politics reporter Vittoria Elliott\u2014\n\nVittoria Elliott: Hi, Leah.\n\nLeah Feiger: Hey, Tori. And from Cambridge, Massachusetts, senior writer Will Knight. Will, thank you so much for coming on. It's your first time here.\n\nWill Knight: Yep. Hello. Thank you for having me.\n\nLeah Feiger: So let's start with porn, if that's OK. Tori, you have a big article out today all about US states tackling the issue of AI-generated porn. Tell us about it. How are people handling this?\n\nVittoria Elliott: It's actually really piecemeal, and that's because on a fundamental level, we don't have national regulation on this. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was herself the target of nonconsensual deepfake porn this year, has introduced the Defiance Act, which would allow victims to sue the people who create and share nonconsensual deepfake porn as long as they can show that the images or videos were made nonconsensually. And then Senator Ted Cruz also has a bill called the Take It Down Act that would let people force platforms to remove those images and videos. But there hasn't really been major movement on these in several months, and this issue has gotten a lot of attention, particularly because we've seen the spate of young people, of middle and high schoolers, using generative AI technology to bully their peers, to make explicit images and videos of their peers. And we obviously have data that shows that while generative AI is maybe still being used in politics, and we definitely have a ton of examples where it is, mostly it's used to target and harass and intimidate women."

            "text": "Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential run against Donald Trump is nearing its final act. And while Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine democracy and leveled vicious personal attacks against her, throughout the campaign so far, the public seen never seen Harris get mad\u2014in fact, she\u2019s full of joy. Her campaign is playfully tapping into the latest social media trends and memes. And rather than complaining and insulting people like Donald Trump, she\u2019s laughing and smiling on the campaign trail. \u201cThe thing we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work,\u201d she told autoworkers in Michigan.\n\nPundits have largely interpreted this as a classic expression of Black joy\u2014a form of incredible resilience in the face of the ugly challenges Black people have long faced in the U.S.\u2014or complained that joy can\u2019t substitute for smart policies (true).\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign has never suggested joy is a policy. It\u2019s a political strategy, and we\u2019re radically underestimating just how smart it is. Adopting a joyful approach has simultaneously highlighted Trump\u2019s biggest weaknesses (his age and cantankerousness), taken the spotlight off him and possibly endeared Harris to the majority of Americans who\u2019ve had enough of our country\u2019s uncivilized politics. It has also deprived Trump of the easiest line of attack he\u2019d otherwise have against Harris\u2014the same attack that Trump had against democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016: the contention that she\u2019s crazy. Expressing rage would allow him to portray Harris as such.\n\n\u201cWhen a man becomes angry in an argument or debate, people are more likely to abandon their own positions and defer to his,\u201d Soraya Chemaly writes in Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women\u2019s Anger. \u201cBut when a woman acts the same way, she\u2019s likely to elicit the opposite response.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just that people wouldn\u2019t believe Harris if she appeared angry. Women candidates often have to walk a tightrope to appear presidential without displaying characteristics that the public accepts without question from men in the public eye. \u201cMale candidates are allowed to yell, to be \u2018passionate\u2019 and volatile. It\u2019s a mark of their dedication,\u201d Gemma Hartley writes in FED UP: Emotional Labor, Women, and the Way Forward.\u201d But, for a woman, \u201ctipping anywhere near yelling means being labeled \u2018shrill,\u2019 and America has a serious problem with shrill women. Assertiveness turns from a leadership trait to a sign of instability when it is a woman on stage.\u201d\n\nAs a Black woman, Harris is especially vulnerable. From early childhood, the behavior of Black women in the U.S. has historically been carefully policed for any perceived expression of dissatisfaction. For example, Black girls are 5.5 times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. And when Black women do try to share their concerns, they\u2019re often simply ignored or written off as \u201ctoo difficult.\u201d\n\nBut eschewing anger isn\u2019t just protecting Harris from political risks. It\u2019s highlighting one of her biggest strengths: the enthusiasm with which her campaign has quickly been met.\n\nRead More: The Reintroduction of Kamala Harris\n\nWhat\u2019s more, something feels fresh and youthful about the way Harris laughs and has fun on the campaign trail. Without lobbing a single insult, it paints a massive contrast with Trump\u2019s two biggest weaknesses: he\u2019s an angry septuagenarian.\n\nThe majority of people in the U.S. \u2013 62%, to be exact\u2013 think Trump is too old to be president, according to a February ABC News/IPSOS poll. We\u2019re also tired of our country\u2019s ugly politics \u2013 literally. Some 65% of Americans always or often feel exhausted when we think about politics, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nHarris\u2019 refusal to rebut Trump\u2019s mean insults and inaccurate claims \u2013 most famously, when she was asked in a CNN interview about Trump\u2019s contention that she isn\u2019t Black and responded that he was using the \u201csame old tired playbook\u201d before asking for the next question\u2014is likely to appeal to voters who want more civility in our politics.\n\nThis approach is also undermining one of Trump\u2019s main strategies on the campaign trail and as president: picking arguments with people. \u201cIt has long been clear that no spectacle is more absorbing than a fight,\u201d Tim Wu wrote in The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside our Heads, which is why one of Trump\u2019s signature strategies has been \u201ccontinuous warfare.\u201d\n\nBy not responding to his attacks, Harris isn\u2019t participating in the spectacle. That\u2019s had the effect of taking a lot of media attention off Trump\u2014one of the most devastating things she could do to him personally and politically. Recall that the continuous coverage the media gave Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign\u2014largely because his unorthodox tactics made for good entertainment\u2014is one of the major things that helped him win that election. But this year, Harris is getting plenty of media attention of her own.\n\nOf course, joy isn\u2019t why voters should cast their ballots for Harris\u2014they should be examining her policies, which she\u2019s continuing to roll out on the trail and which are already having an impact on voters. (For example, low income voters now significantly favor Harris over Trump \u2013 a huge change from June, when they favored Biden by a mere 3 percentage points, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released this week.) But this campaign tactic is making Harris a more formidable political candidate\u2014and signaling to voters that she\u2019ll go about getting things done in new, strategic ways."

Rick Scott for the Senate, has launched a new campaign on WhatsApp to reach voters and attack a sea of disinformation.\n\nThe direct messaging operation is part of a broader attempt to close the gap in a race that has grown increasingly tight. Democrats face an uphill battle undoing Republican gains in the state in recent years, particularly in an election where former President Trump is expected to add to GOP turnout in the state. However, Democrats think they can move the needle, particularly with Latino voters, through smartphones.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's particularly created to target Latino voters across the state to provide them with accurate, factual information coming straight from the source,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell, the sole Latina candidate running for U.S. Senate this year, told NPR.\n\nThe Scott campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe messaging campaign includes two channels on the messaging platform WhatsApp \u2014 one in English and another in Spanish.\n\nThe effort also coincides with a similar launch by the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, which now has its own bilingual channel to reach Latino voters. In their case, the Harris campaign said it was a first-of-its kind in a presidential contest.\n\nThe encrypted platform is a free messaging app that is particularly popular among immigrants, and especially Latinos, to communicate through texts and calls domestically and internationally. With campaigns increasingly looking to use the app, they hope their network will grow with voters as updates are shared by users.\n\nMucarsel-Powell argues WhatsApp will let her directly reach Florida\u2019s Hispanic community, often a target of disinformation. A Pew Research report found 46% of Hispanic Americans use the messaging program compared to a quarter of Americans. It\u2019s used by 23% of Black Americans and 16% of white Americans, the group found.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's very easy to forward, and it's actually one of the reasons why there's been so much disinformation, because of that easy feature, the easy forwarding feature,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell said. \u201cAnd so we wanted to have our own channels to allow our own supporters to just forward the contact to their networks across the state.\u201d\n\nMucarsel-Powell is Democrats\u2019 first Spanish-speaking candidate for U.S. Senate in Florida. And the WhatsApp effort is part of an overall campaign strategy to reach Latino voters who sat out previous elections, which includes dozens of English and Spanish language campaign events so far as well as ads in both languages.\n\nBOLD PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, has identified the Florida Senate race as a top target to address disinformation and reach Latino voters. In the last presidential election in 2020, Mucarsel-Powell and others raised alarm with congressional members over misinformation on WhatsApp and Facebook that was reaching voters.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that Republicans have helped spread misinformation through their campaigns, while Republicans have argued the opposite.\n\nMucarsel-Powell\u2019s campaign faces a tough challenge trying to unseat Scott, the first-term senator now seeking re-election after previously serving as Florida governor.\n\nNow the home state Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump, Florida has largely turned red in recent years. However, Democrats argue their voters have been energized by the Harris presidential campaign and national issues, such as abortion access, which will be on Florida's November ballot."

            "text": "Planned Parenthood of Montana announced on Wednesday a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d that was first identified on August 28, according to a new report from Cyberscoop. The healthcare organization had roughly 93 gigabytes of data stolen by hackers affiliated with RansomHub, who are reportedly giving Planned Parenthood until September 11 to pay an undisclosed amount or have all of the data leaked online.\n\nMartha Fuller, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana, said in a statement to EM360Tech that the organization \u201cimmediately implemented our incident response protocols, including taking portions of our network offline as a proactive security measure.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what kind of data has been stolen and it\u2019s unknown whether patient files have been impacted. Planned Parenthood offers a wide range of health services, but mainstream American perceptions typically associate the organization only with providing abortion care. Whatever is ultimately leaked, if that does come to pass, will almost certainly become a political football in today\u2019s highly politicized environment.\n\nStarted in February 2024, RansomHub works under a \u201cransomware-as-a-service\u201d model, encrypting and exfiltrating data from at least 210 known victims, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Those 2010 victims have been in some of the most sensitive areas of national infrastructure and anything else that helps society run smoothly, according to the CISA, including, \u201cwater and wastewater, information technology, government services and facilities, healthcare and public health, emergency services, food and agriculture, financial services, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing, transportation, and communications critical infrastructure sectors.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood acknowledged the existence of the claims by RansomHub that it hacked the healthcare group but didn\u2019t confirm or deny RansomHub was actually behind the attack.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the RansomHub post, and want to assure our community that we are taking this matter very seriously,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cWe have reported this incident to federal law enforcement, and will support their investigation.\u201d\n\nAbortion is a vitally important issue in American life, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2022 to overturn 50 years of legal precedent by abolishing the federal right to an abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade. The Dobbs decision has been a disaster for human rights in the U.S. and many Americans are understandably upset about having their rights stripped of them.\n\nAnd it\u2019s for that reason many political pundits believe abortion will be a key factor in this November\u2019s election. After all, former president Donald Trump was instrumental in taking away those rights by appointing three Supreme Court justices with views completely outside the mainstream. Trump is currently trailing his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, who notably supports abortion rights, in the key battleground states that will decide the election.\n\nPlanned Parenthood said on Wednesday that the group is working to restore its systems but there\u2019s no timeline on when that may happen.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to our IT staff and cyber security partners, who are working around the clock to securely restore impacted systems as quickly as possible, and who are tirelessly investigating the cause and scope of the incident,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThat investigation is ongoing.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Montana didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions sent Thursday. Gizmodo will update this post when we hear back."

He was also listed as the on-site contact and project manager for the Women for America First rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 where Trump urged the crowd to \u201cstop the steal\u201d before some of them stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAfter Trump participated in a wreath laying ceremony on the third anniversary of the deadly bombing at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members, Trump visited Section 60 at the invitation of some family members and friends of the fallen soldiers.\n\nANC rules, that had been made clear to the Trump campaign in advance, say that only an official Arlington photographer can take pictures or film in Section 60. When an ANC employee tried to enforce the rules, she was verbally abused by the two Trump campaign operatives, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. Picard then pushed her out of the way according to two Pentagon officials.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s conflicting messaging on the incident\n\nAfter NPR first reported the altercation last week, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said they were \u201cprepared to release footage\u201d of the incident, and attacked the Arlington employee as someone \u201cclearly suffering from a mental health episode.\u201d Cheung also said they were granted access to have a photographer present, and pointed to a statement from Gold Star family members that invited Trump to attend the ceremony.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe campaign also released a TikTok video that included video footage from Section 60, including a smiling Trump flashing a thumbs up with family members at the gravesites. But other tombstones are visible in the picture, and at least one family of a fallen Green Beret has confirmed they did not give permission for his grave to be filmed or used in a campaign ad.\n\nThe Army released a statement last Thursday acknowledging that a cemetery employee \u201cwas abruptly pushed aside\u201d and the campaign was warned ahead of time of the prohibition against photography and political activities at Arlington. The Army said the cemetery employee tried to de-escalate the situation after she was pushed, in hopes of not upsetting the Gold Star families in attendance.\n\nThe Army said a police report of the incident was filed, but that the employee had declined to press charges, and that the Army considered the matter closed, but added that \u201cthe ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked.\u201d\n\nWhen NPR emailed both Caporale and Picard, Cheung responded, \u201cI see you've been emailing some of our team members\u2026As the Army has said, they consider this matter closed. President Trump was there to support the Gold Star families and honor the sacrifices their loved ones made.\u201d\n\nCheung also included a social media post that shows a Biden campaign ad from 2020 that used images of the then-vice president at the cemetery in 2010 .\n\nNeither Cheung, Picard or Caporale responded to emailed requests for comment as of publication time. Reached by phone, Caporale referred questions to Cheung. The Trump campaign has still not followed through on its pledge to release video of the incident, despite repeated requests from NPR.\n\nThis week, Trump contradicted his own campaign with a post on Truth Social falsely calling the confrontation a \u201cmade up story by Comrade Kamala and her misinformation squad\u201d that attacked Harris and Biden for not attending the private ceremony.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn an interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show Tuesday, Trump reiterated the false assertion that nothing happened at the cemetery, questioning the motives of the unnamed employee and downplaying the accusations as attacks over \u201cpublicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you notice that the person represented now doesn\u2019t want to talk, he doesn\u2019t want to speak or talk?\u201d Trump asked, mislabeling the employee as male. \u201cThe nice thing, the beautiful thing, was all the parents and relatives got together and they said \u2018That\u2019s a false story, it was totally false.\u2019\u201d\n\nFormer President Trump polls well among veterans , and has many vocal supporters with military ties. Some of the family members who invited him to Arlington also spoke at the Republican National Convention, bashing Biden and vocally endorsing Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden may have forgotten that our children died, but we have not forgotten \u2014 Donald Trump has not forgotten,\" said Cheryl Juels in Milwaukee at the RNC in July. Juels is the aunt of Sgt. Nicole Gee, one of the service members killed at Abbey Gate in 2021, during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal.\n\n\"Joe Biden owes the men and women that served in Afghanistan a debt of gratitude and an apology. Donald Trump loves this country and will never forget the sacrifice and bravery of our service members,\" she added. \"Join us in putting him back in the White House.\"\n\nBut those families do not have the power to suspend the rules at Arlington, where Section 60 is a fresh and on-going memorial to hundreds of recent war dead that, like the rest of the cemetery, is meant to be above politics.\n\nThe family of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a Green Beret who died by suicide after serving multiple combat tours and who is buried in Section 60, said according to their conversations with the cemetery, \"the Trump campaign staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We hope that those visiting this sacred site understand that there were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected and treated accordingly,\" they said in a statement.\n\nJimmy McCain, a US Marine whose father was the late senator John McCain, also condemned the visit .\n\nTrump has a history of controversial remarks about the military - he insulted Sen. John McCain for being a prisoner of war. He allegedly called dead soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" and recently stoked controversy for saying civilian Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients are much better than those who received the Medal of Honor \u2014 the highest military award in the country, often given posthumously.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s conflicting messaging on the campaign trail\n\ntoggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe incident at Arlington National Cemetery is the latest example of conflict between the messaging efforts of Trump\u2019s campaign and the candidate himself since President Biden ended his reelection bid and Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s attempts to use the bombing anniversary to attack Harris over the Afghanistan withdrawal, complete with videos from Gold Star family members blaming the administration for the deaths of their loved ones, has been overshadowed by the politicization of Arlington and its hallowed status.\n\nLast week, both Trump and campaign staff sought to clean up his stance on abortion rights and a ballot measure in his home state of Florida. Trump initially seemed to signal support for the proposed amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and posted that his second term would be \u201cgreat for women and their reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nAfter backlash from anti-abortion advocates and a statement from the campaign saying that Trump did not say how he would vote on the referendum, Trump eventually told a Fox News reporter he would vote against it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump has also publicly questioned the rules, format and fairness for next week\u2019s debate even as his campaign accepted the conditions and has worked behind the scenes to iron out details.\n\nIn a town hall conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity Wednesday, Trump called debate host ABC News \u201cdishonest\u201d and implied without evidence that Harris would get questions in advance.\n\nThe debate will be a pivotal moment for Trump to try and regain momentum against Harris, who has erased Trump\u2019s onetime commanding lead in the polls in the seven key battleground states."

            "headline": "Trump plans New York press conference after hearing appeal arguments in sexual abuse case",
            "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Shortly after appearing in court for an appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, Donald Trump stepped in front of television cameras Friday and brought up a string of past allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct, potentially reminding voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten.\n\nThe former president has made hitting back at opponents and accusers a centerpiece of his political identity, but his performance at his namesake Manhattan office tower was startling even by Trump's combative standards.\n\nAt times, he seemed to relish using graphic language and characterizations of the case brought by advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, which could expose the former president to further legal challenges from Carroll's attorneys. His remarks were especially striking given that they came four days before Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris, with early voting about to begin in some parts of the country and Election Day just two months away.\n\nTrump is doing his best to stay in the public eye while Harris prepares for the debate in private, meeting with her advisers in Pittsburgh. That\u2019s a reflection of their divergent campaign styles, with Trump frequently engaging with reporters \u2014 albeit often in friendly settings \u2014 while Harris has done just one interview and no news conferences since taking President Joe Biden\u2019s place atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nHis team had billed Friday's appearance as a press conference and Trump repeatedly brought up Harris\u2019 lack of news conferences. But Trump took no questions and instead talked about the cases against him for an hour while hardly mentioning any campaign issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president, and I have all these cases all of a sudden come,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re fake cases.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign raised tens of millions of dollars off his previous indictments, convictions and appearances in court. But it\u2019s unclear how focusing on his legal woes will help him now as he works to win over undecided voters \u2014 including independents and those on the fence in critical swing states, ahead of a critical debate on Tuesday that will likely draw tens of millions of viewers.\n\nTrump has disregarded his aides' advice to focus on policy\n\nTrump's trying to seize the political offensive by bringing up allegations against him recalled 2016 when, in the weeks before Election Day, he attempted to dismiss as simple \u201clocker room talk\u201d a recording of him bragging about grabbing, forcibly kissing and sexually assaulting women, which triggered subsequent allegations of misconduct by a string of women.\n\nBut on Friday, standing inside Trump Tower, where he lived for decades before moving to Florida, Trump had many moments that evoked a more distant past.\n\nHe suggested women have accused him of wrongdoing because he is famous. He made a trio of references to how he was already famous in some circles in the 1970s, and talked about his work in the real estate and construction worlds in the 1980s \u2014 before millions of today's voters were born. At one point, he referenced the New York Post's famous \u201cPage Six\u201d gossip section, whose writers have spent decades covering him, as being the internet of its day.\n\nTrump called Carroll's case against him \u201cMonica Lewinsky Part II,\u201d referencing the then-White House intern who had a sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton, and recalled an infamous dress that played a pivotal role in the late-1990s impeachment proceedings against Clinton.\n\nThe former president also repeatedly implied he would not have assaulted two of his accusers due to their looks. He said of a woman who has accused him of sexual misconduct on a plane in the 1970s \u201cshe would not have been the chosen one,\u201d and of Carroll, \u201cI never touched her. I would have had no interest in meeting her in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nHarris, a former California attorney general, says frequently of her opponent's criminal record, \u201cI know Donald Trump's type.\u201d She had no public schedule as she continued debate preparation on Friday, but has built her campaign partly around the idea of prosecuting the case against him \u2014 and the accusations Trump brought up Friday could give her more lines of political attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters and aides have urged him to focus on policy contrasts with Harris instead of personal attacks during the final stretch of a race that remains extremely close.\n\nBut, as Trump spoke, two of his top political advisers were on a call with Republican members of Congress, criticizing the media as being too soft on Harris while saying they felt confident about the race for the White House. Instead, the former president was flanked by his lawyers, some of whom also spoke in defense of their client.\n\nTrump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major candidate\n\nHis comments came after Trump was in court to hear his lawyers argue for overturning a jury's $5 million verdict finding him liable of sexually abusing Carroll in 1996.\n\nJuries now have twice now awarded Carroll huge sums for Trump's claiming she made up a story about him attacking her in a department store dressing room to help her sell a memoir. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from continuing to make nearly identical statements to reporters. On Friday, he said again that Carroll was telling a \u201cmade up, fabricated story.\u201d\n\nCarroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, warned in March after a jury awarded Carroll another $83 million that she would continue to monitor Trump\u2019s comments and would consider suing again if he kept it up. In a speedy response to his Friday comments at Trump Tower, Kaplan said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say it again: All options are on the table.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Trump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major-party nominee.\n\nHe has separately been convicted on 34 felony counts in a New York state case related to hush money payments allegedly made to a porn actor. The judge in that case announced separately Friday that he would postpone sentencing until after Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nTrump has also been ordered to pay steep civil fines for lying about his wealth for years.\n\nAnd he\u2019s still contending with cases alleging his mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 though none are likely to go to trial prior to Election Day."

            "headline": "Right-Wing Influencers Like Tim Pool Allegedly Paid by Kremlin Influence Campaign",
            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department revealed a Russian influence campaign and charged two RT employees with two counts of conspiracy in an unsealed indictment on Wednesday. According to the indictment, two employees of the Kremlin-run media company RT spent $10 million on right-wing media personalities and poisoning the well of American discourse.\n\nThe two Russians, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva funneled money into a Tennessee-based media company to get the job done. The indictment doesn\u2019t name the company or the media personalities it hired, but it\u2019s not hard to use clues in the court documents to figure out everyone involved. The unsealed indictment quotes the company\u2019s description of itself on its own website as a \u201cnetwork of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one company based in Tennessee with that phrase on its website: TENET Media. TENET Media is an outlet that publishes on YouTube and other social media. It has paid for videos from people like Benny Johnson, Tim Pool, David Rubin, Matt Christiansen, and Lauren Southern.\n\nWhat kind of content did Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva get for their $10 million? \u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s indictment, Russian state broadcaster RT and its employees, including the charged defendants, co-opted online commentators by funneling them nearly $10 million to pump pro-Russia propaganda and disinformation across social media to U.S. audiences,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.\n\nThe most watched video on TENET Media\u2019s YouTube channel is a documentary from Southern about online dating. The second most popular is Southern talking about the great replacement conspiracy theory. Its most recent video is a 12-minute long low-effort rant from Benny Johnson about Kamala Harris. So far it has less than five thousand views.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Pool, Johnson, and the rest were making decent money churning out content for the site. In 2022, Tenet went looking for people to be the face of the operation. \u201c\u2018For the right candidate we\u2019re willing to pay around $1-2 million per year,\u2019\u201d they said, according to court records. That\u2019s a lot of cash for videos that would go on to routinely net under ten thousand views.\n\nThe founders reached out to two commentators\u2014believed to be Tim Pool and either Benny Johnson or David Rubin\u2014and asked them how much they\u2019d need to come work for them. \u201cFounder-I advised that Commentator-I said \u2018it would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,\u2019 and that Commentator-2 said \u2018it would take 100k per weekly episode to make it worth his while,\u2019\u201d the indictment said.\n\nThe indictment made clear that Pool, Rubin, Johnson, and the rest didn\u2019t know that they were being sponsored by the Russians. The three have all released statements in the past 24 hours claiming that they, themselves, were victims.\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed by the allegations in today\u2019s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,\u201d Johnson said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cThese allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme,\u201d Rubin said on X. \u201cI knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.\u201d\n\nPool emphasized that the charges are allegations and, like the others, said he was a victim. \u201cThat being said, we still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,\u201d Pool said in a post on X. \u201cPutin is a scumbag, Russia sucks donkey balls.\u201d He later deleted the post. Pool has been vocal in opposing U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the indictment, all three men made hundreds of thousands of dollars making videos for TENET media. One creator made $400,000 a month on top of a $100,000 signing bonus. Again, that\u2019s a lot of cash for videos no one was watching.\n\nThe unsealed indictment was just one of several coordinated announcements from Washington on Wednesday aimed at striking back against Russia for election interference. The Treasury said it would sanction 10 individuals and two entities as part of the effort. In addition to the indictment, the DoJ announced the seizure of 32 internet domains it said spread disinformation using AI.\n\nDisinformation campaigns are a staple of modern geopolitics. Countries like the U.S., China, Russia, and Iran all spend money manipulating the media of their friends and rivals. In February of this year, Reuters reported that the U.S. military spread anti-vax propaganda in the Philippines during the pandemic with the goal of undermining China. Earlier this month, Microsoft accused Iran of running disinformation campaigns in the U.S.\n\nDisinformation campaigns are not always subtle and, if discovered, can undermine the intended message. Modern Russian campaigns are odd though, they\u2019re often designed with the knowledge that they\u2019ll be discovered. Russia isn\u2019t always interested in convincing people of any one thing, it\u2019s more about making everyone paranoid and distrustful. The knowledge that RT, and by extension the Kremlin, paid for Pool, Johnson, and Rubin to make videos is destabilizing in itself, regardless of the content they generate.\n\nReuters reached out to RT for comment on the indictment and RT gave them a statement that can be read as both a flippant joke and bizarre promise. \u201cThree things are certain in life: death, taxes, and RT\u2019s interference in the US elections,\u201d RT told Reuters."

Dabei handelt es sich wohl um einen Witz, wie F.A.Z.-Korrespondent Friedrich Schmidt schreibt:\n\n\n\nSchon im Februar hatte Putin Joe Biden als vorzugsw\u00fcrdig gegen\u00fcber dem seinerzeit noch voraussichtlichen Kandidaten der Republikaner, Donald Trump, bezeichnet, da der Amtsinhaber \u201eerfahrener\u201c und \u201evorhersehbar\u201c sei.\n\n\n\nIn Anspielung darauf sagte Putin am Donnerstag auf seinem allj\u00e4hrlichen Wirtschaftsforum in Wladiwostok in Russlands Fernem Osten, Biden sei, soweit man \u00fcberhaupt von \u201eFavoriten\u201c sprechen k\u00f6nne, da \u201enicht wir das zu bestimmen haben\u201c, sondern das \u201eamerikanische Volk\u201c, Russlands \u201eFavorit\u201c gewesen. Nachdem Biden nun nicht mehr \u201eim Rennen\u201c sei, aber seinen Mitstreitern empfohlen habe, Harris zu unterst\u00fctzen, \u201ewerden also auch wir das machen, werden wir sie unterst\u00fctzen\u201c, sagte Putin zur Erheiterung von Publikum und Moderatorin und l\u00e4chelte dabei sarkastisch.\n\n\n\nDass Harris \u201eansteckend lacht\u201c, zeige, \u201edass bei ihr alles gut ist\u201c, fuhr Putin im selben Ton fort. Trump dagegen habe in dessen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft so viele \u201eBeschr\u00e4nkungen und Sanktionen\u201c gegen Russland verh\u00e4ngt wie zuvor kein amerikanischer Pr\u00e4sident. \u201eWenn bei Frau Harris alles gut ist, unterl\u00e4sst sie wom\u00f6glich solche Handlungen\u201c, sagte Putin. Letztlich habe \u201edas amerikanische Volk die Wahl, und mir werden diese Wahl respektieren\u201c.\n\n\n\nAm Mittwoch hat das amerikanische Finanzministerium neue Sanktionen gegen russische Staatsmedien wie den Sender RT, dessen Chefin Margarita Simonjan und weitere Personen aus dessen Umfeld verh\u00e4ngt und dies mit Versuchen begr\u00fcndet, die Pr\u00e4sidentenwahlen im November zu beeinflussen. Generalstaatsanwalt Merrick Garland sagte bei der Vorstellung von Vorw\u00fcrfen gegen zwei demnach in Russland ans\u00e4ssige RT-Mitarbeiter, es gehe Moskau darum, die Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr die Ukraine zu diskreditieren.\n\n\n\nUnter anderem habe RT mit fast zehn Millionen Dollar ein Unternehmen im amerikanischen Bundesstaat Tennessee gegr\u00fcndet, um auch unter Mitwirkung heimischer Influencer Russlands Interessen verdeckt voranzutreiben.

            "text": "The Federal Trade Commission sued earlier this year to prevent the deal.\n\nA possible $24.6 billion deal between supermarket rivals, Kroger and Albertsons, has hit another roadblock with the U.S. government, but the CEO has pledged to cut prices by $1 billion on day one to try and save the proposed deal.\n\nAfter the U.S. government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the deal, chief executive of the nation's third-largest general retailer Rodney McMullen took the stand in a federal courtroom in Oregon on Wednesday as part of a three week hearing to defend the merger with Albertsons.\n\nKroger CEO Rodney McMullen leaves federal court after testifying during a federal court hearing, Sept. 4, 2024, in Portland, Ore. Jenny Kane/AP\n\nMcMullen argued that the move would allow the company to drop prices and compete with bigger retail companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco.\n\nThe definitive merger agreement was first announced in October 2022 and last month the Federal Trade Commission, and states of Colorado and Washington, filed a lawsuit to stop the merger, arguing it would \"eliminate competition\" in the 22 states where the companies currently compete and raise grocery prices for millions during a time when Americans are already paying more due to high inflation on food.\n\nA Kroger grocery store. Jonathan Weiss/Adobe Stock\n\nOn Wednesday, McMullen said Albertsons prices are 10 to 12% higher than that of Kroger's and argued that the merged company could aim to shrink that gap in its new strategy to retain customers.\n\nIf combined, Albertsons and Kroger would control around 13% of U.S. grocery sales, which is still short of Walmart that currently controls nearly 22%.\n\nCincinnati-based Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter.\n\nBoise-based Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.\n\nAn Albertsons grocery store in Lafayette, La.

            "text": "Trump gets criminal sentencing delayed till after presidential election\n\ntoggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nA New York judge on Friday delayed the sentencing in a criminal case against former President Donald Trump in order to ensure the court is seen as politically impartial.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan set the new sentencing date for Nov. 26, a few weeks after the election. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide payments to an adult film star.\n\n\u201cThe imposition of sentence will be adjourned to avoid any appearance\u2014however unwarranted\u2014that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate,\u201d Merchan said in his decision. \u201cThe Court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMerchan also postponed consideration on whether to overturn the criminal conviction in light of a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity and other evidence. That hearing is now set for Nov. 12.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision on July 1 came after Trump was convicted in New York \u2014 but before he was sentenced. The timing threw into disarray what was already an unprecedented felony conviction against a former president and current Republican presidential nominee.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers say the Supreme Court decision means his case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, should be cleared entirely.\n\n\"The Manhattan D.A. Witch Hunt has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was NO CASE, I DID NOTHING WRONG!\" Trump posted on the Truth Social website. \"It is a political attack against me.\"\n\nTrump's legal team argued that various testimony, such as that of former White House employees, and evidence, like statements made while he was president, violate the Supreme Court ruling that decided presidents have immunity for official acts they take in office.\n\nHis lawyers have spent the summer trying to blunt the case\u2019s impact on the election, in part by accusing Merchan of political bias. They\u2019ve asked Merchan to overturn the conviction, appealed it, sought to delay the sentencing until after the election, and remove Merchan and move the case to federal jurisdiction.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA spokeswoman for the district attorney, Danielle Filson, said the DA's office \"stands ready for sentencing on the new date set by the court.\"\n\n\"A jury of 12 New Yorkers swiftly and unanimously convicted Donald Trump of 34 felony counts,\" she said in a statement.\n\nFundraising tool\n\nNew York jurors in May unanimously agreed that Trump falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nEven without a delay in his sentence, Trump has sought to use the conviction as a fundraising tool. Within 24 hours of the guilty verdict, Trump\u2019s campaign boasted of raising millions of dollars. Since officially being named GOP presidential nominee, he has continued to discuss the trials at various campaign events.\n\nThe jury heard from 22 witnesses during about four weeks of testimony in Manhattan\u2019s criminal court. Jurors also weighed other evidence \u2014 mostly documents like phone records, invoices and checks to Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s once-loyal \u201cfixer,\u201d who paid Daniels to keep her story of an alleged affair with the former president quiet.\n\nThe facts of the payments and invoices labeled as legal services were not in dispute.\n\nWhat prosecutors needed to prove was that Trump falsified the records in order to further another crime \u2014 in this case, violating the New York election law that makes it a crime for \u201cany two or more persons [to] conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\u201d\n\nThe jurors were able to choose whether those unlawful means were violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, falsifying tax returns or falsifying other business records.\n\nThe verdict came more than a year after a grand jury indicted Trump on March 30, 2023, marking the first time a former or sitting president faced criminal charges.\n\n\u2014With assistance from Franco Ordo\u00f1ez."

Sie gelten als wahlentscheidend - hier kommt es auf jede Stimme an. Bei der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl am 5. November tritt die Demokratin Harris gegen ihren republikanischen Kontrahenten Trump an.

Die erzkonservative Politikerin gilt als lauteste Trump-Kritikerin unter den Republikanern. Daf\u00fcr hat sie einen hohen Preis gezahlt.

Cheney hatte sich erst nach der Kapitol-Attacke offen gegen Trump gestellt. Zuvor unterst\u00fctzte sie seine Politik weitgehend.\n\nEs war erwartet worden, dass Cheney sich in diesen Tagen zur Wahl positionieren w\u00fcrde. W\u00e4hrend des Parteitags der Demokraten in Chicago im August gab es auch das Ger\u00fccht, dass die Republikanerin dort auftreten k\u00f6nnte. Dies tat sie letztlich aber nicht. Ihr Parteifreund Adam Kinzinger, der neben Cheney das einzige republikanische Mitglied im Kapitol-Ausschuss war, hielt allerdings in Chicago eine Rede.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240905-930-223361/1"

Weiter\n\nTV-Duell zwischen Biden und Trump wirkt nach\n\nTrump d\u00fcrfte aus dem TV-Duell mit dem damaligen demokratischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerber, US-Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden, im Juni gelernt haben. Damals waren die Mikrofone desjenigen, der gerade nicht sprach, stummgeschaltet. Die Stummschaltung soll Berichten zufolge auf Bidens Team zur\u00fcckgegangen sein. Damit h\u00e4tten die Demokraten verhindern wollen, dass Trump den 81 Jahre alten Demokraten st\u00e4ndig unterbreche. Nach der Debatte kamen Beobachter aber zu dem Schluss, dass Trump die stumm geschalteten Mikros eher geholfen h\u00e4tten, weil der 78-J\u00e4hrige so kontrollierter gewirkt habe. Bidens Auftritt hingegen war ein Desaster - und hatte seinen R\u00fcckzug aus dem Rennen zur Folge.\n\nTrump hatte sich dar\u00fcber aufgeregt, dass Harris diese Regeln nun \u00e4ndern wollte und indirekt damit gedroht, die ganze TV-Debatte abzublasen. Die damalige Debatte zwischen Trump und Biden wurde vom als liberal geltenden US-Sender CNN ausgerichtet, nun ist ABC an der Reihe. Trump nannte den Sender im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Hannity \u00abunehrlich\u00bb und verwies auf eine Freundschaft zwischen Harris und einer Managerin des Senders. Der Republikaner sagte, er habe nur zugestimmt, weil Harris' Team auf den Sender bestanden habe. Der 78-J\u00e4hrige hatte der Debatte bereits vor Monaten zugestimmt, damals war Biden noch im Rennen.\n\nStift, Papier und Wasser sind erlaubt\n\nABC k\u00fcndigte nun an, dass die Debatte 90 Minuten dauern werde, zwei Werbepausen seien geplant.

Harris und Trump w\u00fcrden einen Stift, einen Block Papier und eine Flasche Wasser erhalten. Trump behauptete nun in der Sendung bei Fox News, dass Harris gefordert habe, Notizen mit in das Duell nehmen zu d\u00fcrfen.\n\nAn dieser Stelle ist ein externer Inhalt eingebunden Zum Anschauen ben\u00f6tigen wir Ihre Zustimmung Bitte aktivieren Sie JavaScript damit Sie diesen Inhalt anzeigen k\u00f6nnen. Weiter\n\nTownhall bei Fox News ohne Zuschauerfragen\n\nBei Trumps Gespr\u00e4ch mit Hannity am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) handelte es sich um eine sogenannte Townhall. Bei einem solchen Format sind auch Fragen aus dem Publikum zugelassen. In der rund einst\u00fcndigen Sendung auf Fox News, die im umk\u00e4mpften Bundesstaat Pennsylvania aufgezeichnet wurde, kam aber kein Zuschauer zu Wort. \u00abThe Hill\u00bb berichtete, entsprechende Zuschauerfragen an Trump sollten am Donnerstag ausgestrahlt werden. In der Sendung am Mittwoch lobte Hannity den republikanischen Kandidaten \u00fcber den gr\u00fcnen Klee. Er sagte etwa: \u00abSie haben einen hohen Preis daf\u00fcr gezahlt, dass Sie in die politische Arena eingestiegen sind.\u00bb Trump w\u00fcrde von der Justiz verfolgt, obwohl er sich eigentlich ein sch\u00f6nes Leben machen k\u00f6nnte, sagte Hannity.\n\nFox News war eine Zeit lang etwas von Trump abger\u00fcckt - und unterst\u00fctzte eher den damaligen republikanischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerber Ron DeSantis. Mittlerweile steht der Sender aber wieder eisern hinter Trump. Aktuell ist nicht geplant, dass Fox News eine TV-Debatte im Wahlkampf ausrichtet. Es k\u00f6nnte durchaus sein, dass die Debatte auf ABC die einzige zwischen Trump und Harris bleiben wird. Nach Bidens Ausstieg aus dem Rennen war der ganze Plan f\u00fcr die ausgehandelten TV-Debatten \u00fcber den Haufen geworfen worden.\n\nKnappes Rennen erwartet\n\nBei der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl am 5. November l\u00e4uft es auf ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen zwischen Harris und Trump hinaus - in Umfragen liegen sie etwa gleichauf. Der geringe Abstand zwischen beiden Kandidaten liegt im Bereich der Fehlertoleranz. Allerdings hat das Rennen mit Harris' \u00dcbernahme der Kandidatur neuen Schwung gewonnen. Trump hatte der Wechsel bei den Demokraten augenscheinlich etwas unvermittelt getroffen - er schien sich auf seinen politischen Erzfeind Biden eingeschossen zu haben und arbeitet nun an einer neuen Strategie. Er wirft Harris vor, eine radikale Linke zu sein.\n\nAm Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) meldete sich eine altbekannte Trump-Kritikerin zu Wort: Die Republikanerin Liz Cheney k\u00fcndigte an, bei der Wahl f\u00fcr Harris stimmen zu wollen. Die Ansage ist keine wirkliche \u00dcberraschung. Dass eingefleischte Republikaner aber \u00f6ffentlich dazu aufrufen, Demokraten zu w\u00e4hlen, ist schon sehr ungew\u00f6hnlich. Gleichzeitig freute Trump sich dar\u00fcber, dass der Bruder des demokratischen Vizekandidaten Tim Walz sich kritisch \u00fcber diesen ge\u00e4u\u00dfert hatte. Entsprechende Facebook-Posts von Jeff Walz hatten zuletzt f\u00fcr Aufmerksamkeit gesorgt.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240905-930-223368/4"

            "text": "Wladiwostok (dpa) \u2013 Vor der Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl in den USA hat Kremlchef Wladimir Putin seine angebliche Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Kandidatin Kamala Harris erkl\u00e4rt. Die US-Politikerin habe so ein ausdrucksstarkes und \u00abansteckendes Lachen\u00bb, das zeuge davon, dass f\u00fcr sie alles gut sei, sagte Putin beim \u00d6stlichen Wirtschaftsforum in Wladiwostok am Pazifik.\n\nEr habe immer gesagt, dass er US-Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden favorisiere. Putin hatte gelobt, dass Biden berechenbarer sei als sein Vorg\u00e4nger Donald Trump. Da Biden aus dem Wahlkampf herausgenommen worden sei und sich nun f\u00fcr Harris einsetze, \u00abwerden wir sie auch unterst\u00fctzen\u00bb. Die Wahl sei aber beim US-amerikanischen Volk, sagte Putin.\n\nDer 71-J\u00e4hrige \u00e4u\u00dferte sich im Beisein von Malaysias Regierungschef Anwar Ibrahim bei einer Plenarsitzung zu Fragen des Welthandels und zur internationalen Politik. Der Kremlchef kritisierte, dass besonders auch unter Trump US-Sanktionen gegen Russland erlassen worden seien. \u00abTrump hat so viele Beschr\u00e4nkungen und Sanktionen gegen Russland verh\u00e4ngt, wie kein Pr\u00e4sident vor ihm. Und wenn es Frau Harris gut geht, wird sie vielleicht von dieser Art von Ma\u00dfnahmen absehen\u00bb, sagt er unter Hinweis auf ihr Lachen.\n\nWashington: Putin soll sich aus unseren Wahlen heraushalten\n\n\u00abHerr Putin sollte aufh\u00f6ren, \u00fcber unsere Wahlen zu sprechen\u00bb, sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrates, John Kirby, angesprochen auf Putins \u00c4u\u00dferung. Er solle niemanden bevorzugen. Nur die amerikanischen W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hlern w\u00fcrden entscheiden, wer der n\u00e4chste US-Pr\u00e4sident werde. \u00abWir w\u00fcrden es sehr zu sch\u00e4tzen wissen, wenn Herr Putin aufh\u00f6ren w\u00fcrde, \u00fcber unsere Wahlen zu reden und aufh\u00f6ren w\u00fcrde, sich in sie einzumischen\u00bb, so Kirby weiter.\n\nDie US-Regierung wirft Russland eine Einmischung in die bevorstehende Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl im November vor. Die USA belegten am Mittwoch mehrere Personen und Organisationen mit Sanktionen, darunter Vertreter des staatlichen russischen Senders RT (fr\u00fcher Russia Today), wie das Finanzministerium und Justizminister Merrick Garland in Washington mitteilten. Garland sagte, der innere Kreis rund um Putin habe russische PR-Firmen angewiesen, \u00abDesinformation und staatlich gef\u00f6rderte Narrative als Teil einer Kampagne zur Beeinflussung der US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen 2024 zu f\u00f6rdern\u00bb.\n\nUSA werfen Russland Wahleinmischung vor\n\nSchon bei fr\u00fcheren US-Wahlen hatte sich Moskau nach Angaben offizieller amerikanischer Stellen eingemischt. Nach Ansicht der US-Geheimdienste setzte sich Russland bei der Wahl 2020 f\u00fcr den Republikaner Trump ein und bem\u00fchte sich, dem Demokraten Biden zu schaden. Moskau habe den Ausgang der Wahl beeinflussen und Unfrieden im Land s\u00e4en wollen, hie\u00df es in einem ver\u00f6ffentlichten Geheimdienst-Bericht.\n\nAuch bei der Wahl 2016 hatte Russland nach \u00dcberzeugung der US-Sicherheitsbeh\u00f6rden zugunsten des Kandidaten Trump interveniert, um die Demokratin Hillary Clinton auszubremsen. Ein Sonderermittler untersuchte sp\u00e4ter m\u00f6gliche illegale Absprachen zwischen Russland und Trumps Team. Daf\u00fcr gab es keine ausreichenden Hinweise.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:240905-930-223749/2"

            "text": "US-Republikaner f\u00fcr Harris Unterst\u00fctzung aus dem gegnerischen Lager Stand: 07.09.2024 01:53 Uhr\n\nNicht alle Republikaner unterst\u00fctzen ihren US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten - einige warnen sogar vor Trump. Und manche gehen noch weiter: Sie unterst\u00fctzen \u00f6ffentlich seine Gegnerin Harris. Ist das ein Grund zur Sorge f\u00fcr Trump?\n\nSie werde alles tun, um die R\u00fcckkehr von Donald Trump ins Wei\u00dfe Haus zu verhindern, sagt Liz Cheney seit Monaten. Und nun hat die prominente Republikanerin angek\u00fcndigt, nicht einfach nur nicht f\u00fcr Donald Trump zu stimmen, sondern seine Gegnerin, die Demokratin Kamala Harris, im Rennen ums Wei\u00dfe Haus zu unterst\u00fctzen - aufgrund der Gefahr, die Donald Trump darstelle.\n\nDie Tochter von Ex-Vize-Pr\u00e4sident Dick Cheney hat nun au\u00dferdem erkl\u00e4rt, dass auch ihr Vater f\u00fcr Kamala Harris stimmen werde. Liz Cheney hatte sich seit dem Angriff auf das US-Kapitol 2021 offen gegen Trump gestellt, verlor deshalb am Ende ihre F\u00fchrungsrolle in der republikanischen Partei und ihren Sitz im Abgeordnetenhaus. Liz Cheney war eine von nur zwei Republikanern im Untersuchungsausschuss zum Sturm auf das US-Kapitol.\n\nLiz Cheney (links) und ihr Vater (Archivbild aus August 2022): Dick Cheney war unter George W. Bush von 2001 bis 2009 Vize-Pr\u00e4sident der USA.\n\nRepublikaner auf dem Demokraten-Parteitag\n\nDer zweite war Adam Kinzinger. Auch der ehemalige Abgeordnete warnt seitdem vor Trump und unterst\u00fctzt Harris \u00f6ffentlich. In der ABC-Late Night Show Jimmy Kimmel sagte Kinzinger vor einigen Tagen, seine Partei sei aus den Fugen geraten und verteidige die Demokratie nicht mehr.\n\nAuf dem Parteitag der Demokraten trat Kinzinger auf, als einer von mehreren republikanischen Rednern. Der ehemalige Vize-Gouverneur von Georgia, Geoff Duncan, nutzte die B\u00fchne, um an seine Parteifreunde und an unentschlossene W\u00e4hler zu appellieren, Harris zu w\u00e4hlen. Die republikanische Partei sei nicht mehr b\u00fcrgerlich oder konservativ. Sie sei chaotisch und verr\u00fcckt. Das einzige was \u00fcbrig bleibe, sei Trump fallenzulassen - \"Dump Trump\", so Duncan.\n\nDer republikanische Ex-Kongressabgeordnete Adam Kinzinger spricht auf dem Parteitag der Demokraten. Auch Trumps ehemalige Pressesprecherin Stephanie Grisham hielt dort eine Rede.\n\nBeispiellos - und wahlentscheidend?\n\nAndere Republikaner wie Trumps damaliger Vizepr\u00e4sident, Mike Pence, verwehren Trump ihre Unterst\u00fctzung, gehen aber nicht so weit, dazu aufzurufen, Harris zu w\u00e4hlen. Dass namhafte Republikaner wie Liz Cheney das tun, sei absolut beispiellos in den USA, sagt Politikwissenschaftler Chris Edelson von der American University in Washington.\n\nDiese einzigartige Situation k\u00f6nne einen Einfluss auf das Wahlergebnis haben, vor allem mit Blick auf die wahlentscheidenden Swing States, in denen Trump und Harris in Umfragen sehr eng beieinanderliegen, so Edelson. Selbst wenn Liz Cheney in einem Swing State - Bundesstaaten, die mal republikanisch, mal demokratisch w\u00e4hlen und deshalb besonders umk\u00e4mpft sind - nur ein paar Tausend W\u00e4hler beeinflusse, k\u00f6nne das den Unterschied ausmachen. Erfahrungen aus anderen L\u00e4ndern wiesen darauf hin.\n\nParallelen zur Frankreich-Wahl 2017\n\nPolitikwissenschaftler Edelson erinnert an 2017, als Emmanuel Macron in Frankreich das Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsrennen gegen die Rechtspopulistin Marine LePen gewann. Edelson sieht Parallelen zu der momentanen Situation in den USA. In normalen Zeiten unterst\u00fctzten Republikaner Republikaner und Demokraten Demokraten. Die Situation jetzt sei ein Signal, das den W\u00e4hlern sage, dass etwas sehr Ungew\u00f6hnliches passiere.\n\n\"Es ist wie in Frankreich im Jahr 2017, als Konservative Macron und seine Partei gegen Le Pen unterst\u00fctzt haben. Es gibt Anzeichen daf\u00fcr, dass dies einen Effekt hatte\", so Edelson. Wie gro\u00df der Effekt am Ende tats\u00e4chlich sein wird, sei nicht vorherzusehen. Aber, wenn er Trump w\u00e4re, sagt der Politikwissenschaftler, w\u00fcrde er sich Sorgen machen."

It turns out they are distant cousins.\n\nThe photo shows eight smiling people wearing navy pro-Trump shirts, underneath a \"Trump 2024 \u2014 Take America Back\u201d sign. The photo was eventually reposted by former President Donald Trump, who wrote on his Truth Social platform: \u201cIt is a Great Honor to have your Endorsement. I look forward to meeting you soon!\u201d\n\nThe photo was first posted on X by Charles Herbster, a former candidate for governor in Nebraska who had Trump\u2019s endorsement in the 2022 campaign. Herbster\u2019s spokesperson, Rod Edwards, said the people in the photo are cousins to the Minnesota governor, who is now Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate.\n\n\u201cThe family in the picture are the descendants of Francis Walz, who was brother to Tim Walz\u2019s grandfather,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey\u2019re all Walzes and spouses.\u201d\n\nThe descendants of Francis Walz confirmed their relationship to Tim Walz in a text message to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cShortly after Governor Tim Walz was named the Democrat Party Vice Presidential nominee, our family had a get-together. We had t-shirts made to show support for President Trump and J.D. Vance and took a group picture. That photo was shared with friends, and when we were asked for permission to post the picture, we agreed,\u201d the written statement said.\n\n\u201cThe picture is real. The shirts are real. We are the Nebraska Walz family and we are related to Gov. Tim Walz, our grandfathers were brothers. The message on the shirts speaks for itself, \u201cNebraska Walzs for Trump.\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s sister, Sandy Dietrich, of Alliance, Nebraska, said she suspected it might be people from that branch of the family. Dietrich and Walz\u2019s father, James Walz, died of lung cancer in 1984 when the future congressman and Minnesota governor was just a teenager. His father had been the school superintendent in Valentine, Nebraska.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t close with them. We didn\u2019t know them,\u201d she said.\n\nDietrich declined to comment on their distant cousins\u2019 opposition to her brother and referred to herself and her family as \u201cDemocrats for Tim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who I\u2019m voting for. That\u2019s all I can control,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Tim Walz\u2019s other surviving sibling is not behind his candidacy.\n\nIn recent days, the New York Post has reported on Facebook comments from the governor\u2019s older brother, Jeff Walz of Freeport, Florida, in which he said of his younger sibling: \u201cThe stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.\u201d The 67-year-old also wrote that he was \u201c100% opposed to all his ideology\u201d and had thought about endorsing Trump, the Post reported.\n\nIn comments published Wednesday by NewsNation, Jeff Walz said that he was still irked he learned on the radio that his brother would be Harris\u2019 running mate, but that he didn\u2019t intend to influence the political debate and doesn\u2019t want to be involved with anybody\u2019s campaign.\n\nJeff Walz told NewsNation that he and the 60-year-old governor have not spoken since the funeral of their younger brother, Craig Walz, in 2016, aside from a brief phone call last month through their mother. He told NewsNation that what he was referring to in his post by \u201cstories\u201d were from their childhood.\n\n\u201cNobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us, that sort of thing,\u201d Jeff Walz said. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else. There\u2019s other stories like that, but I think that probably gives you the gist of it.\u201d\n\nHe also told NewsNation that he would make no further statements on the subject. He did not immediately return messages left Wednesday by the AP.\n\n\u2014Associated Press writers Randy Herschaft and Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report."

They are the constant northern star of political prediction,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nIf all 13 questions or statements, also known as \"keys\", are found to be true, then the system predicts than the incumbent will win the election.\n\nSuch questions include if there is a \"charismatic incumbent\" and if there is currently a \"strong short-term economy.\"\n\nWhile Harris is not technically the incumbent president, she can be viewed as such for the sake of Lichtman's system as the current VP in the current presidential branch,\n\nLichtman's key system predicts the incumbent party will win eight or more of the 13 statements are true.\n\nHe said the Harris campaign has eight \"true\" keys, meaning she is predicted to win in a still-close race.\n\n\n\nBut Lichtman has not shared his decision on two of the 13 keys - for if there is a major foreign policy failure, or a foreign policy success.\n\n\n\nThe historian these keys could rapidly change due to the government's handling of the war in Gaza. Lichtman explained that even if these two keys flipped to Trump, he would still not be predicted to win as that would add up to five false answers.\n\nThe historian believes that one of the reasons Harris is likely to win in 2023, is the Democratic Party's move to throw their support behind her and avoid a Primary after Joe Biden dropped out.\n\n\"The Democrats finally got smart and united overwhelmingly behind Vice President Harris,\" he told the Times.\n\nTrump reveals reason he agreed to strict Kamala Harris debate rules as ABC showdown to include muted mics & no audience\n\nThis meant Lichtman the key statement, \"There is no primary contest for the incumbent party nomination,\" is true.\n\nOther true keys have included no third party challenger, a strong short term economy, major policy changes, and stronger long-term economic growth in the last two terms of Biden's tenure.\n\nIn fact, Lichtman's only confident false answers were for the midterm gains key, as the Democrats lost House seats, the incumbency key, as Biden is not running for re-election, and the incumbent charisma key.\n\nLichtman noted two keys that could swing either way.\n\nThe other keys that swung in Harris's favor were no major social unrest and no White House scandal.\n\nThe 13 Keys to the White House HISTORIAN Allan Lichtman predicts the winner of presidential elections by using his algorithm that consists of 13 true or false statements.

She then announced a program to assist states that have laws allowing police to temporarily seize guns from people judges have found to be dangerous.\n\nHarris, who leads the new White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, has supported both stronger gun controls, such as banning sales of AR-15 and similar rifles, and better school security, like making sure classroom doors don't lock from the outside as they did in Parkland."

His response was a lengthy, utterly incoherent word salad that seemed to suggest widespread tariffs would solve the problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important issue.

This year, voters will decide the winner of the presidency \u2014 and, by extension, Trump\u2019s legal fate. A D.C. grand jury indictment accused Trump of actions resulting in the violent siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. If he reclaims the White House, he\u2019s expected to direct new Justice Department leaders to drop the landmark case.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Trump claims the new indictment is election interference, saying it violates a DOJ policy about taking big steps too close to an election, NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson tells Up First. Judge Tanya Chutkan will need to figure out how to draw the line between which of Trump\u2019s actions in the White House were part of his presidential duties and which were made as a candidate for office. Johnson says there\u2019s no way this will be resolved before the election and it might not go to trial until next year due to the possibility of the Supreme Court's involvement.\n\nFederal officials are accusing Russia of using unwitting right-wing American influencers to spread Kremlin propaganda ahead of the November presidential election. Yesterday, the Justice Department charged two employees of RT, Russian state media, in the scheme. Investigators say they helped publish online videos that racked up 16 million views on YouTube and other social media platforms. The staffers named in the indictment are Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 The goal seems to be amplifying topics like immigration, inflation and undermining support for Ukraine without indication that RT was behind the videos, NPR\u2019s Shannon Bond says. The indictment says the employees funneled nearly $10 million to a Tennessee company to make the alleged scheme work. The company was not named, but details match one called Tenet Media. The Russian employees allegedly had a good deal of control over the content, allowing them to push for very specific angles that echoed Kremlin narratives.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToday's listen\n\ntoggle caption Terry Wyatt/Getty Images North America\n\nGrammy-winning folk duo Gillian Welch and David Rawlings have made a career singing about hard times.

He is the author of the 2018 book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood , an exploration of border conflicts, unrecognized countries, and changes to the world map.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Vice President Kamala Harris shake hands at the end of a press conference at the Munich Security Conference on February 17, 2024. Tobias Schwarz/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIs Vice President Kamala Harris a \u201chuman rights hawk,\u201d who would use American power to promote democracy and freedom abroad? Or is she a \u201cpragmatic internationalist\u201d who would back gingerly away from American hegemony?\n\n\n\nIs she poised to end an era of American hubris and restore humility to our foreign policy? Or does her forceful rhetoric on America\u2019s role in the world reveal an \u201cinner Reagan\u201d?\n\nTwo months out from the presidential election, there\u2019s rampant speculation about what a \u201cHarris doctrine\u201d for foreign policy could look like, but it often seems to reveal more about what the person doing the speculating wants (or doesn\u2019t want) in the next president than any particular worldview articulated by Harris.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the vice president doesn\u2019t have a track record to examine. While some coverage has portrayed her as something of a foreign-policy neophyte, she would come into office with more global experience than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, or Donald Trump had.\n\nAs vice president, she has met with dozens of world leaders, represented the US at global gatherings, and attended the president\u2019s daily intelligence briefings. In her Democratic National Convention address, she touted the fact that she had been the one to brief Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on US intelligence about the looming Russian invasion in Munich just days before it occurred in 2022.\n\nThe administration has also noted her role in the recent prisoner swap with Russia. She also was involved in US efforts to strengthen alliances in Southeast Asia, particularly with the Philippines. And though she was not the \u201cborder czar\u201d she\u2019s sometimes portrayed as in attack ads, she did lead the administration\u2019s efforts to address the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration through aid to Central America.\n\nWhat\u2019s harder to pin down is how she might differ from the Biden administration, which is what all the \u201cHarris doctrine\u201d speculation is trying to pin down. When it comes to that, the analysis often comes down to \u2014 to use the buzzword of the moment \u2014 vibes.\n\nSame message, new tone\n\nIn a recent Time feature on Harris\u2019s record on Ukraine, Ukrainian officials acknowledged she had been engaged on the issue and showed sympathy for the country\u2019s plight, but one official described it as feeling like \u201cformal sympathy, following protocol.\u201d\n\nIn a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show podcast, the host speculated that as the child of immigrants with a more global perspective, Harris \u201cdoes not have that identification\u201d with Israel that Americans of Joe Biden\u2019s generation do. But that\u2019s not quite how Harris has described her own upbringing. In a 2017 speech to the right-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) she reminisced that as a child in the Bay Area, she collected donations for the Jewish National Fund to plant trees in Israel. In 2019, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency described her Senate record as \u201cmore AIPAC than J Street,\u201d referring to the more left-leaning \u201cpro peace\u201d lobbying group.\n\nWhen it comes to how Harris might differ, even subtly, from Biden, perhaps no issue, foreign or domestic, has gotten more attention than the war in Gaza.\n\nHalie Soifer, who worked as national security adviser to Harris in the Senate and is now the director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told Vox that when it comes to policy on Israel and Gaza, there is little daylight between the two.\n\n\u201cI think the policy will not change,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we have seen is some distinction when it comes to the way they speak about the conflict, with Vice President Harris not only reiterating her commitment to Israel and its security, but also expressing a larger degree of empathy with innocent Palestinian civilians.\u201d\n\nThis was reflected in pointed remarks Harris made calling for a ceasefire at a civil rights commemoration in Selma, Alabama, in March (remarks that were reportedly watered down by administration officials) as well as in her convention speech. As my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote, that speech did not differ particularly from Biden\u2019s talking points but did, rhetorically at least, present \u201cPalestinian aspirations for self-determination as the moral climax of her discussion of the issue.\u201d\n\nSlate\u2019s Fred Kaplan reports that sources close to Harris say she \u201cprivately disagrees with [Biden\u2019s] formulation of world politics as a contest between democracy and autocracy \u2026 and sees that as oversimplifying and even misleading, given the kinds of allies that we\u2019re sometimes forced to choose.\u201d The Biden administration has been criticized by some observers for paying attention to the \u201cglobal south\u201d mainly in the context of competition with Russia and China.\n\nPerhaps reflecting some desire to move beyond this framing, Harris remarked at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that when visiting countries in Africa, she was constantly asked, \u201c\u2018Are you here because of China?\u2019 And my answer was, \u2018No, we are here because of the people on the continent of Africa.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhy campaign promises can\u2019t tell us much about Harris\u2019s real policies\n\nIt\u2019s also quite possible that Harris\u2019s worldview and foreign policy rhetoric are simply evolving. The senator who, in 2020, said, \u201cI unequivocally agree with the goal of reducing the defense budget and redirecting funding to communities in need\u201d is now the vice president who vows to \u201censure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.\u201d\n\nUltimately, campaign rhetoric will only tell you so much about how a president will conduct foreign policy. Some analysts have noted that, as a senator, Harris was in favor of cutting support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, and called for \u201cfundamentally reevaluating\u201d the US-Saudi relationship as a candidate in 2020. But then again, Biden promised on the campaign trail to make Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman a \u201cpariah\u201d before putting cooperation with the country at the center of his Middle East policy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that campaign talk is cheap, it\u2019s that, as the noted international relations theorist Mike Tyson put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\n\nGeorge W. Bush came into office promising a \u201chumble\u201d foreign policy that eschewed nation-building crusades. 9/11 changed that.\n\nObama first distinguished himself as an opponent of US militarism in the Middle East but will be remembered for expanding the US drone war, the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, and helping to overthrow the government of Libya.\n\nBiden\u2019s foreign policy legacy will be determined in large part by his response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the October 7 attacks.\n\n\u201cForeign policy priorities, in every administration, are largely dictated by events,\u201d Soifer said.\n\nIf there is a \u201cHarris doctrine,\u201d we\u2019ll learn what it is only if we see her as president."

He confirmed that he has not been part of Harris\u2019 debate prep nor her selection of Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I am going to do is give her advice on something she is really awesome at,\u201d he told Kimmel. \u201cIf she asks me something I will let her know what I think, but we really try to keep that separate because we really want to be there for each other, our family, our kids, all that stuff.\u201d\n\nEmhoff did note that he expects Harris to win the upcoming debate with no issues. \u201cAs she is preparing for the debate, somebody asked me, \u2018Well what is it like debating her?

            "text": "ANALYSIS \u2014 Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris described each other as a threat to voters\u2019 wallets and constitutional rights during their first campaign stops since Labor Day.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, opted for the bigger splash, taping a town hall in swing-state Pennsylvania that aired in prime time on Fox News. (Though billed as a town hall, only the host asked questions, not voters seated in the New Holland Arena, which was lined with sections of empty seats.)\n\nHarris made a campaign stop in New Hampshire, a state the Democratic nominee has won every cycle since 2004.\n\nThe nominees were back on the campaign trail as new polling further solidified both camps\u2019 assessments that the race likely will be extremely close in November.\n\nCNN-SSRS polling released Wednesday morning showed that neither Trump nor Harris has a clear path to the White House, with both candidates running close in the battleground states that likely will decide the election.\n\nHarris led in both Georgia and Nevada by a single point, 48 percent to 47 percent. They were tied in Pennsylvania. Harris had larger leads in Wisconsin (6 percentage points) and Michigan (5 points). Trump led 49 percent to 44 percent in Arizona, according to the polling, which had a 4.9 percent margin of error.\n\nHere are four takeaways from their campaign stops, with 60 days to go until Election Day.\n\n\u2018We have a little lead\u2019\n\nDespite the CNN polling released earlier Wednesday, Trump continued to dismiss polls that suggest the race has swung since President Joe Biden ended his bid for another term.\n\n\u201cI hear the polls are close, and we have a little lead. I just find it hard to believe. First of all, they\u2019ve been so bad,\u201d Trump told Fox commentator and host Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done such a bad job. But that\u2019s why the enthusiasm is so bad,\u201d Trump said, falsely suggesting that there has been no surge in excitement among Democratic voters since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.\n\nBut when Republican-leaning polling firms like Rasmussen release surveys putting him comfortably ahead nationally, Trump pushes them hard on social media. What\u2019s more, the former president appeared to miss an opportunity to appeal directly to grieving voters in what Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales calls a toss-up state after a 14-year-old student killed four people Wednesday at a high school in Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe had this shooting today in Georgia,\u201d Hannity noted at the start of the program. Trump replied, \u201cRight.\u201d And when Hannity said Americans were sending prayers to the families and victims, Trump said nothing. Georgia is among the key swing states that analysts expect will decide the election.\n\n\u2018How nice our criminals are\u2019\n\nAmid calls from some Republican lawmakers for Trump to stick to several policy issues \u2014 chiefly illegal immigration and the Biden economic record \u2014 the former president got one of his biggest applause lines on the former.\n\n\u201cWe have to do the largest deportation in \u2026 history,\u201d Trump told Hannity, with the Fox commentator calling those who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally \u201cunvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants.\u201d The crowd in Harrisburg, Pa., roared.\n\nTrump continued to call Harris \u201cthe border czar, whether you like it or not\u201d \u2014 a title White House officials have said Biden never gave his No. 2; they contend he put her in charge of diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of illegal border crossings.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to use that term, she was in charge of the border. It\u2019s the worst border in the history of the world,\u201d Trump said, ignoring federal law enforcement agencies\u2019 data that White House and Harris campaign officials have pointed to for weeks showing that border crossings have been declining. In fact, in late June, administration officials said illegal crossings were down 40 percent since Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nHannity did not ask Trump about Harris\u2019 sharp criticism of the effort he spearheaded that led to Republican senators tanking an immigration and border package that one of the most conservative Republicans, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, had negotiated with Democrats and the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions to sink that deal have become Harris\u2019 go-to retort when Trump and other Republicans slam her with the \u201cborder czar\u201d line.\n\nTrump, who is a convicted felon awaiting sentencing in a New York business fraud case, falsely described the United States as being overrun by illegal migrants who were murderers, drug dealers and \u201cwoman traffickers\u201d back home. Then came one of the night\u2019s oddest lines, especially from Trump, who has said negative things about those convicted of violent crimes in major cities with Democratic local and state officials.\n\n\u201cOur criminals are nice people by comparison,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re showing how nice our criminals are.\u201d\n\n\u2018Opportunity economy\u2019\n\nHarris used her campaign event in North Hampton, N.H., to announce her latest economic proposal amid Republican criticism \u2014 including from Trump \u2014 that she had both been complicit in what they call poorly crafted policy under Biden and her lack of a plan of her own.\n\nThe Democratic nominee laid out a proposal to expand the small-business tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000, part of what she described as \u201cbuilding an opportunity economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe America\u2019s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy. Think about it \u2026 small businesses in our country employ half of all private-sector employees,\u201d she said. \u201cThey generate revenue that helps pave our roads and pay our teachers.\u201d\n\nIn a clip-and-save moment, she also set a goal of 25 million small-business applications during her four-year term, if elected in November. Harris described her plan as \u201cessentially a tax cut for starting a small business.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s campaign touted analyses from financial firm Goldman Sachs that estimated, should Democrats sweep both chambers of Congress and the White House, job growth would be 10,000 better per month than if Trump won with a divided Congress \u2014 and 30,000 higher per month under a GOP sweep.\n\nBut the Trump campaign described her announcement as a \u201csham small business \u2018plan.\u2019\u201d In a statement, his campaign contended that \u201cKamala\u2019s $20 billion plan is just another cog in the wheel of her multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending scheme that would add trillions to the debt and drive costs up even higher.\u201d\n\nHarris is attempting to pivot to the middle, while Trump\u2019s campaign wants to paint her as a progressive pretending to be a populist.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t trust women\u2019\n\nHarris\u2019 stop in the Granite State was not all about her small-business proposals \u2014 she also again went right after Trump.\n\nA rally-goer appeared to yell out, \u201cLock him up,\u201d referring to the once-convicted and twice-impeached Trump\u2019s legal cases. Harris did not venture into the legal realm, however.\n\n\u201cThe courts are going to handle that, and we will handle November,\u201d she fired back, to loud applause. \u201cHow about that?\u201d Later, she accused Trump of aiming to \u201cterminate the Constitution.\u201d\n\nShe accused the former president of \u201cgaslighting\u201d voters on the end of federal abortion rights, noting that he had appointed three of the Supreme Court\u2019s six right-leaning justices who voted to do so.\n\nShe alleged that Trump would, if elected, create a \u201cnational anti-abortion coordinator, which would force states \u2026 to report on women\u2019s miscarriages and abortions,\u201d she said, adding of Republicans: \u201cThey don\u2019t trust women.\u201d\n\n\u201cOurs is a fight for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it is a fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nTrump often refers to \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d Democrats. Harris wants to flip that charge on him."

She is a patriot who loves this country and puts our democracy and our Constitution first.\u201d\n\nCheney joins other Republicans, like fellow January 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger and Denver Riggleman, both former congressmen, in supporting Harris.\n\nMore than 200 alumni of the Bush administration and former Republican presidential campaigns of the late Senator John McCain and Senator Mitt Romney also announced their endorsement of Harris last week.\n\nAsked for comment, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded: \u201cWho is Liz Cheney and what does she do?\u201d"

But, while it was renewed for a fourth season in late 2021, there has been little clue of when it would air again.\n\nStar Rob McElhenney did hint at the show's return on X, responding to a fan's query. When asked if there was going to be a fourth season \"Or can I cancel my apple subscription?\" the star offered they should \"Maybe hold onto it.\"\n\nMcElhenney also shared a picture where he posed with costars in front of the logo of the show.\n\nThe third season \"Mythic Quest\" aired on Apple TV+ starting in November 2022. It is unclear when the fourth season itself will be made available for viewing, or for that matter, how far along production is.\n\nIn December of the same year, it was reported a spinoff titled \"Mere Mortals\" was being worked on. The spinoff was set to take the concept of episodes like \"Dark Quiet Death\" or \"Backstory!\" to step outside the usual plot to tell other stories.\n\nThe spinoff is written by Ashly Burch, John Howell Harris, and Kate McElhenney, with Ubisoft, Lionsgate, and 3Arts Entertainment producing it."

            "text": "For two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow would back US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, in presidential elections in November.\n\nThe nature of Putin\u2019s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.\n\nYet whatever Putin\u2019s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader\u2019s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.\n\nThis is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate. Putin himself has been in Russia\u2019s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.\n\nAl Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president\u2019s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.\n\nDid Putin endorse Harris?\n\nAt an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his \u201cfavourite\u201d.\n\nSince Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin\u2019s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.\n\nHe added that Harris has an \u201cexpressive and infectious laugh\u201d, which indicates \u201cshe\u2019s doing well\u201d. The audience broke into scatted laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m insulted or he did me a favour,\u201d Republican challenger Trump responded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.\n\n2004: Putin endorses Bush\n\nIn October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the \u201cspread of terrorism\u201d globally.\n\nBush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nThis was amid the war on Iraq which started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.\n\nBush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.\n\n2008: Russia leans towards Obama win\n\nWhile Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain was Russia\u2019s preferred outcome.\n\nWhile both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.\n\nAfter being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.\n\nHence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in \u201ctandemocracy\u201d.\n\nObama won the 2008 election.\n\n2012: Putin praises Obama\n\nAhead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was \u201can honest person who really wants to change much for the better\u201d.\n\nRomney had deemed Russia the top \u201cgeopolitical foe\u201d of the US, something Putin said Romney was \u201cmistaken\u201d about, during the same interview.\n\nObama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.\n\n2015: Putin deems Trump \u2018outstanding and talented\u2019\n\nAhead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.\n\n\u201cHe is a bright and talented person without any doubt,\u201d he said, adding that Trump is \u201coutstanding and talented\u201d.\n\nTrump was up against Democratic challenger Hilary Clinton in the election.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election victory, Putin said Trump was a \u201cclever man\u201d who would \u201cquickly understand\u201d his role in office.\n\n2016: US blames Russia for DNC leaks, election interference\n\nIn July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails were hacked and leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nPutin denied Russia\u2019s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. \u201cThe important thing is the content that was given to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.\n\n2019: Putin jokes Russia will meddle in 2020 election\n\nIn October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret: Yes, we\u2019ll definitely do it. Just don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.\n\nHe then said his working relationship with Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.\n\n\u201cWe have our own problems,\u201d he said."

Other signatories include Chris Larsen, who helped found the blockchain platform Ripple, and Box CEO Aaron Levie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of the letter\u2019s signatories are former business executives, from former Blackstone CEO Tony James and Lazard CEO Peter Orszag to the many former heads of public companies. Executives who once led Pepsico, Merck, Starbucks, PayPal, and Ford all made the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA number of donors aligned with Harris \u2014 or the Democratic party more broadly \u2014also signed the letter, including Laurene Powell Jobs, NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, former Walt Disney Studios chairman and Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.\n\nSeveral of these people have already gone to bat for Harris in the almost two months since she became the defacto Democratic nominee.

She has also pledged to take aim at high prescription drug prices, expensive grocery bills, and Wall Street\u2019s home buying spree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs analysts, the best outcome of the 2024 presidential election, at least for the economy, would be a Harris win and a Democratic sweep of Congress. The worst scenarios occur when Former President Donald Trump gets back into office and implements tougher controls on immigration and high tariffs on imported goods, the analysts said.\n\nTrump\u2019s economic proposals would also increase the federal deficit by $5.8 trillion over the next decade, almost five times more than Harris\u2019 proposals, which would add $1.2 trillion, according to recent studies from The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model."
